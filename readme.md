# Star Wars Dialog

A bot to tweet opening crawls and spoken lines from George Lucas’ saga, in order, as originally released.

One exception to original release format is to include the addition of “Episode IV – A NEW HOPE” to the opening crawl of the original 1977 movie. Otherwise, these lines do not follow the late-1990s Special Editions.

Lines are sourced from the movies’ subtitles, with the addition of some non-subtitled Huttese and Ewokese in “Episode VI – RETURN OF THE JEDI” (sourced from [Wookieepedia G-Canon (“Legends”)](//starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Legends#Official_levels_of_canon) and [Wermo’s Guide](//www.completewermosguide.com/)).

The bot accepts Node arguments to set its starting index (defaults to 0) and time interval (defaults to 77 minutes).
