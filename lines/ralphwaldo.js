'ESSAYS, FIRST SERIES',
'By RALPH WALDO EMERSON',
'I: HISTORY',
'There is no great and no small',
'To the Soul that maketh all:',
'And where it cometh, all things are',
'And it cometh everywhere.',
'I am owner of the sphere,',
'Of the seven stars and the solar year,',
'Of Cæsar’s hand, and Plato’s brain,',
'Of Lord Christ’s heart, and Shakspeare’s strain.',
'There is one mind common to all individual men.',
'Every man is an inlet to the same and to all of the same.',
'He that is once admitted to the right of reason is made a freeman of the whole estate.',
'What Plato has thought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has befallen any man, he can understand.',
'Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent.',
'Of the works of this mind history is the record.',
'Its genius is illustrated by the entire series of days.',
'Man is explicable by nothing less than all his history.',
'Without hurry, without rest, the human spirit goes forth from the beginning to embody every faculty, every thought, every emotion, which belongs to it, in appropriate events.',
'But the thought is always prior to the fact; all the facts of history preexist in the mind as laws.',
'Each law in turn is made by circumstances predominant, and the limits of nature give power to but one at a time.',
'A man is the whole encyclopaedia of facts.',
'The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, lie folded already in the first man.',
'Epoch after epoch, camp, kingdom, empire, republic, democracy, are merely the application of his manifold spirit to the manifold world.',
'This human mind wrote history, and this must read it.',
'The Sphinx must solve her own riddle.',
'If the whole of history is in one man, it is all to be explained from individual experience.',
'There is a relation between the hours of our life and the centuries of time.',
'As the air I breathe is drawn from the great repositories of nature, as the light on my book is yielded by a star a hundred millions of miles distant, as the poise of my body depends on the equilibrium of centrifugal and centripetal forces,',
'so the hours should be instructed by the ages and the ages explained by the hours.',
'Of the universal mind each individual man is one more incarnation.',
'All its properties consist in him.',
'Each new fact in his private experience flashes a light on what great bodies of men have done, and the crises of his life refer to national crises.',
'Every revolution was first a thought in one man’s mind, and when the same thought occurs to another man, it is the key to that era.',
'Every reform was once a private opinion, and when it shall be a private opinion again it will solve the problem of the age.',
'The fact narrated must correspond to something in me to be credible or intelligible.',
'We, as we read, must become Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and king, martyr and executioner; must fasten these images to some reality in our secret experience, or we shall learn nothing rightly.',
'What befell Asdrubal or Cæsar Borgia is as much an illustration of the mind’s powers and depravations as what has befallen us.',
'Each new law and political movement has meaning for you.',
'Stand before each of its tablets and say, ‘Under this mask did my Proteus nature hide itself.’',
'This remedies the defect of our too great nearness to ourselves.',
'This throws our actions into perspective; and as crabs, goats, scorpions, the balance and the waterpot lose their meanness when hung as signs in the zodiac, so I can see my own vices without heat in the distant persons of Solomon, Alcibiades, and Catiline.',
'It is the universal nature which gives worth to particular men and things.',
'Human life, as containing this, is mysterious and inviolable, and we hedge it round with penalties and laws.',
'All laws derive hence their ultimate reason; all express more or less distinctly some command of this supreme, illimitable essence.',
'Property also holds of the soul, covers great spiritual facts, and instinctively we at first hold to it with swords and laws and wide and complex combinations.',
'The obscure consciousness of this fact is the light of all our day, the claim of claims; the plea for education, for justice, for charity; the foundation of friendship and love and of the heroism and grandeur which belong to acts of self-reliance.',
'It is remarkable that involuntarily we always read as superior beings.',
'Universal history, the poets, the romancers, do not in their stateliest pictures,—in the sacerdotal, the imperial palaces, in the triumphs of will or of genius,—anywhere lose our ear, anywhere make us feel that we intrude, that this is for better men;',
'but rather is it true that in their grandest strokes we feel most at home.',
'All that Shakspeare says of the king, yonder slip of a boy that reads in the corner feels to be true of himself.',
'We sympathize in the great moments of history, in the great discoveries, the great resistances, the great prosperities of men;—',
'because there law was enacted, the sea was searched, the land was found, or the blow was struck, for us, as we ourselves in that place would have done or applauded.',
'We have the same interest in condition and character.',
'We honor the rich because they have externally the freedom, power, and grace which we feel to be proper to man, proper to us.',
'So all that is said of the wise man by Stoic or Oriental or modern essayist, describes to each reader his own idea, describes his unattained but attainable self.',
'All literature writes the character of the wise man.',
'Books, monuments, pictures, conversation, are portraits in which he finds the lineaments he is forming.',
'The silent and the eloquent praise him and accost him, and he is stimulated wherever he moves, as by personal allusions.',
'A true aspirant therefore never needs look for allusions personal and laudatory in discourse.',
'He hears the commendation, not of himself, but, more sweet, of that character he seeks, in every word that is said concerning character, yea further in every fact and circumstance,—in the running river and the rustling corn.',
'Praise is looked, homage tendered, love flows, from mute nature, from the mountains and the lights of the firmament.',
'These hints, dropped as it were from sleep and night, let us use in broad day.',
'The student is to read history actively and not passively; to esteem his own life the text, and books the commentary.',
'Thus compelled, the Muse of history will utter oracles, as never to those who do not respect themselves.',
'I have no expectation that any man will read history aright who thinks that what was done in a remote age, by men whose names have resounded far, has any deeper sense than what he is doing to-day.',
'The world exists for the education of each man.',
'There is no age or state of society or mode of action in history to which there is not somewhat corresponding in his life.',
'Every thing tends in a wonderful manner to abbreviate itself and yield its own virtue to him.',
'He should see that he can live all history in his own person.',
'He must sit solidly at home, and not suffer himself to be bullied by kings or empires, but know that he is greater than all the geography and all the government of the world;',
'he must transfer the point of view from which history is commonly read, from Rome and Athens and London, to himself, and not deny his conviction that he is the court, and if England or Egypt have any thing to say to him he will try the case;',
'if not, let them for ever be silent.',
'He must attain and maintain that lofty sight where facts yield their secret sense, and poetry and annals are alike.',
'The instinct of the mind, the purpose of nature, betrays itself in the use we make of the signal narrations of history.',
'Time dissipates to shining ether the solid angularity of facts.',
'No anchor, no cable, no fences avail to keep a fact a fact.',
'Babylon, Troy, Tyre, Palestine, and even early Rome are passing already into fiction.',
'The Garden of Eden, the sun standing still in Gibeon, is poetry thenceforward to all nations.',
'Who cares what the fact was, when we have made a constellation of it to hang in heaven an immortal sign?',
'London and Paris and New York must go the same way.',
'“What is history,” said Napoleon, “but a fable agreed upon?”',
'This life of ours is stuck round with Egypt, Greece, Gaul, England, War, Colonization, Church, Court and Commerce, as with so many flowers and wild ornaments grave and gay.',
'I will not make more account of them.',
'I believe in Eternity.',
'I can find Greece, Asia, Italy, Spain and the Islands,—the genius and creative principle of each and of all eras, in my own mind.',
'We are always coming up with the emphatic facts of history in our private experience and verifying them here.',
'All history becomes subjective; in other words there is properly no history, only biography.',
'Every mind must know the whole lesson for itself,—must go over the whole ground.',
'What it does not see, what it does not live, it will not know.',
'What the former age has epitomized into a formula or rule for manipular convenience, it will lose all the good of verifying for itself, by means of the wall of that rule.',
'Somewhere, sometime, it will demand and find compensation for that loss, by doing the work itself.',
'Ferguson discovered many things in astronomy which had long been known.',
'The better for him.',
'History must be this or it is nothing.',
'Every law which the state enacts indicates a fact in human nature; that is all.',
'We must in ourselves see the necessary reason of every fact,—see how it could and must be.',
'So stand before every public and private work;',
'before an oration of Burke, before a victory of Napoleon, before a martyrdom of Sir Thomas More, of Sidney, of Marmaduke Robinson;',
'before a French Reign of Terror, and a Salem hanging of witches;',
'before a fanatic Revival and the Animal Magnetism in Paris, or in Providence.',
'We assume that we under like influence should be alike affected, and should achieve the like; and we aim to master intellectually the steps and reach the same height or the same degradation that our fellow, our proxy has done.',
'All inquiry into antiquity, all curiosity respecting the Pyramids, the excavated cities, Stonehenge, the Ohio Circles, Mexico, Memphis,—is the desire to do away this wild, savage, and preposterous There or Then, and introduce in its place the Here and the Now.',
'Belzoni digs and measures in the mummy-pits and pyramids of Thebes, until he can see the end of the difference between the monstrous work and himself.',
'When he has satisfied himself, in general and in detail, that it was made by such a person as he, so armed and so motived, and to ends to which he himself should also have worked, the problem is solved;',
'his thought lives along the whole line of temples and sphinxes and catacombs, passes through them all with satisfaction, and they live again to the mind, or are now.',
'A Gothic cathedral affirms that it was done by us and not done by us.',
'Surely it was by man, but we find it not in our man.',
'But we apply ourselves to the history of its production.',
'We put ourselves into the place and state of the builder.',
'We remember the forest-dwellers, the first temples, the adherence to the first type, and the decoration of it as the wealth of the nation increased; the value which is given to wood by carving led to the carving over the whole mountain of stone of a cathedral.',
'When we have gone through this process, and added thereto the Catholic Church, its cross, its music, its processions, its Saints’ days and image-worship, we have as it were been the man that made the minster; we have seen how it could and must be.',
'We have the sufficient reason.',
'The difference between men is in their principle of association.',
'Some men classify objects by color and size and other accidents of appearance; others by intrinsic likeness, or by the relation of cause and effect.',
'The progress of the intellect is to the clearer vision of causes, which neglects surface differences.',
'To the poet, to the philosopher, to the saint, all things are friendly and sacred, all events profitable, all days holy, all men divine.',
'For the eye is fastened on the life, and slights the circumstance.',
'Every chemical substance, every plant, every animal in its growth, teaches the unity of cause, the variety of appearance.',
'Upborne and surrounded as we are by this all-creating nature, soft and fluid as a cloud or the air, why should we be such hard pedants, and magnify a few forms?',
'Why should we make account of time, or of magnitude, or of figure?',
'The soul knows them not, and genius, obeying its law, knows how to play with them as a young child plays with graybeards and in churches.',
'Genius studies the causal thought, and far back in the womb of things sees the rays parting from one orb, that diverge, ere they fall, by infinite diameters.',
'Genius watches the monad through all his masks as he performs the metempsychosis of nature.',
'Genius detects through the fly, through the caterpillar, through the grub, through the egg, the constant individual;',
'through countless individuals the fixed species;',
'through many species the genus;',
'through all genera the steadfast type;',
'through all the kingdoms of organized life the eternal unity.',
'Nature is a mutable cloud which is always and never the same.',
'She casts the same thought into troops of forms, as a poet makes twenty fables with one moral.',
'Through the bruteness and toughness of matter, a subtle spirit bends all things to its own will.',
'The adamant streams into soft but precise form before it, and whilst I look at it its outline and texture are changed again.',
'Nothing is so fleeting as form; yet never does it quite deny itself.',
'In man we still trace the remains or hints of all that we esteem badges of servitude in the lower races;',
'yet in him they enhance his nobleness and grace;',
'as Io, in Æschylus, transformed to a cow, offends the imagination;',
'but how changed when as Isis in Egypt she meets Osiris-Jove, a beautiful woman with nothing of the metamorphosis left but the lunar horns as the splendid ornament of her brows!',
'The identity of history is equally intrinsic, the diversity equally obvious.',
'There is, at the surface, infinite variety of things; at the centre there is simplicity of cause.',
'How many are the acts of one man in which we recognize the same character!',
'Observe the sources of our information in respect to the Greek genius.',
'We have the civil history of that people, as Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, and Plutarch have given it; a very sufficient account of what manner of persons they were and what they did.',
'We have the same national mind expressed for us again in their literature, in epic and lyric poems, drama, and philosophy; a very complete form.',
'Then we have it once more in their architecture, a beauty as of temperance itself, limited to the straight line and the square,—a builded geometry.',
'Then we have it once again in sculpture, the “tongue on the balance of expression,” a multitude of forms in the utmost freedom of action and never transgressing the ideal serenity;',
'like votaries performing some religious dance before the gods, and, though in convulsive pain or mortal combat, never daring to break the figure and decorum of their dance.',
'Thus of the genius of one remarkable people we have a fourfold representation: and to the senses what more unlike than an ode of Pindar, a marble centaur, the peristyle of the Parthenon, and the last actions of Phocion?',
'Every one must have observed faces and forms which, without any resembling feature, make a like impression on the beholder.',
'A particular picture or copy of verses, if it do not awaken the same train of images, will yet superinduce the same sentiment as some wild mountain walk, although the resemblance is nowise obvious to the senses, but is occult and out of the reach of the understanding.',
'Nature is an endless combination and repetition of a very few laws.',
'She hums the old well-known air through innumerable variations.',
'Nature is full of a sublime family likeness throughout her works, and delights in startling us with resemblances in the most unexpected quarters.',
'I have seen the head of an old sachem of the forest which at once reminded the eye of a bald mountain summit, and the furrows of the brow suggested the strata of the rock.',
'There are men whose manners have the same essential splendor as the simple and awful sculpture on the friezes of the Parthenon and the remains of the earliest Greek art.',
'And there are compositions of the same strain to be found in the books of all ages.',
'What is Guido’s Rospigliosi Aurora but a morning thought, as the horses in it are only a morning cloud?',
'If any one will but take pains to observe the variety of actions to which he is equally inclined in certain moods of mind, and those to which he is averse, he will see how deep is the chain of affinity.',
'A painter told me that nobody could draw a tree without in some sort becoming a tree;',
'or draw a child by studying the outlines of its form merely,—but, by watching for a time his motions and plays, the painter enters into his nature and can then draw him at will in every attitude.',
'So Roos “entered into the inmost nature of a sheep.”',
'I knew a draughtsman employed in a public survey who found that he could not sketch the rocks until their geological structure was first explained to him.',
'In a certain state of thought is the common origin of very diverse works.',
'It is the spirit and not the fact that is identical.',
'By a deeper apprehension, and not primarily by a painful acquisition of many manual skills, the artist attains the power of awakening other souls to a given activity.',
'It has been said that “common souls pay with what they do, nobler souls with that which they are.”',
'And why?',
'Because a profound nature awakens in us by its actions and words, by its very looks and manners, the same power and beauty that a gallery of sculpture or of pictures addresses.',
'Civil and natural history, the history of art and of literature, must be explained from individual history, or must remain words.',
'There is nothing but is related to us, nothing that does not interest us,—kingdom, college, tree, horse, or iron shoe,—the roots of all things are in man.',
'Santa Croce and the Dome of St. Peter’s are lame copies after a divine model.',
'Strasburg Cathedral is a material counterpart of the soul of Erwin of Steinbach.',
'The true poem is the poet’s mind; the true ship is the ship-builder.',
'In the man, could we lay him open, we should see the reason for the last flourish and tendril of his work; as every spine and tint in the sea-shell preexists in the secreting organs of the fish.',
'The whole of heraldry and of chivalry is in courtesy.',
'A man of fine manners shall pronounce your name with all the ornament that titles of nobility could ever add.',
'The trivial experience of every day is always verifying some old prediction to us and converting into things the words and signs which we had heard and seen without heed.',
'A lady with whom I was riding in the forest said to me that the woods always seemed to her to wait, as if the genii who inhabit them suspended their deeds until the wayfarer had passed onward;',
'a thought which poetry has celebrated in the dance of the fairies, which breaks off on the approach of human feet.',
'The man who has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at midnight, has been present like an archangel at the creation of light and of the world.',
'I remember one summer day in the fields my companion pointed out to me a broad cloud,',
'which might extend a quarter of a mile parallel to the horizon, quite accurately in the form of a cherub as painted over churches,—a round block in the centre,',
'which it was easy to animate with eyes and mouth, supported on either side by wide-stretched symmetrical wings.',
'What appears once in the atmosphere may appear often, and it was undoubtedly the archetype of that familiar ornament.',
'I have seen in the sky a chain of summer lightning which at once showed to me that the Greeks drew from nature when they painted the thunderbolt in the hand of Jove.',
'I have seen a snow-drift along the sides of the stone wall which obviously gave the idea of the common architectural scroll to abut a tower.',
'By surrounding ourselves with the original circumstances we invent anew the orders and the ornaments of architecture, as we see how each people merely decorated its primitive abodes.',
'The Doric temple preserves the semblance of the wooden cabin in which the Dorian dwelt.',
'The Chinese pagoda is plainly a Tartar tent.',
'The Indian and Egyptian temples still betray the mounds and subterranean houses of their forefathers.',
'“The custom of making houses and tombs in the living rock,” says Heeren in his Researches on the Ethiopians, “determined very naturally the principal character of the Nubian Egyptian architecture to the colossal form which it assumed.',
'In these caverns, already prepared by nature, the eye was accustomed to dwell on huge shapes and masses, so that when art came to the assistance of nature it could not move on a small scale without degrading itself.',
'What would statues of the usual size, or neat porches and wings have been, associated with those gigantic halls before which only Colossi could sit as watchmen or lean on the pillars of the interior?”',
'The Gothic church plainly originated in a rude adaptation of the forest trees, with all their boughs, to a festal or solemn arcade; as the bands about the cleft pillars still indicate the green withes that tied them.',
'No one can walk in a road cut through pine woods, without being struck with the architectural appearance of the grove, especially in winter, when the barrenness of all other trees shows the low arch of the Saxons.',
'In the woods in a winter afternoon one will see as readily the origin of the stained glass window, with which the Gothic cathedrals are adorned, in the colors of the western sky seen through the bare and crossing branches of the forest.',
'Nor can any lover of nature enter the old piles of Oxford and the English cathedrals, without feeling that the forest overpowered the mind of the builder, and that his chisel, his saw and plane still reproduced its ferns,',
'its spikes of flowers,',
'its locust, elm, oak, pine, fir and spruce.',
'The Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone subdued by the insatiable demand of harmony in man.',
'The mountain of granite blooms into an eternal flower, with the lightness and delicate finish as well as the aerial proportions and perspective of vegetable beauty.',
'In like manner all public facts are to be individualized, all private facts are to be generalized.',
'Then at once History becomes fluid and true, and Biography deep and sublime.',
'As the Persian imitated in the slender shafts and capitals of his architecture the stem and flower of the lotus and palm,',
'so the Persian court in its magnificent era never gave over the nomadism of its barbarous tribes, but travelled from Ecbatana, where the spring was spent, to Susa in summer and to Babylon for the winter.',
'In the early history of Asia and Africa, Nomadism and Agriculture are the two antagonist facts.',
'The geography of Asia and of Africa necessitated a nomadic life.',
'But the nomads were the terror of all those whom the soil or the advantages of a market had induced to build towns.',
'Agriculture therefore was a religious injunction, because of the perils of the state from nomadism.',
'And in these late and civil countries of England and America these propensities still fight out the old battle, in the nation and in the individual.',
'The nomads of Africa were constrained to wander, by the attacks of the gad-fly, which drives the cattle mad, and so compels the tribe to emigrate in the rainy season and to drive off the cattle to the higher sandy regions.',
'The nomads of Asia follow the pasturage from month to month.',
'In America and Europe the nomadism is of trade and curiosity; a progress, certainly, from the gad-fly of Astaboras to the Anglo and Italo-mania of Boston Bay.',
'Sacred cities, to which a periodical religious pilgrimage was enjoined, or stringent laws and customs, tending to invigorate the national bond, were the check on the old rovers; and the cumulative values of long residence are the restraints on the itineracy of the present day.',
'The antagonism of the two tendencies is not less active in individuals, as the love of adventure or the love of repose happens to predominate.',
'A man of rude health and flowing spirits has the faculty of rapid domestication, lives in his wagon and roams through all latitudes as easily as a Calmuc.',
'At sea, or in the forest, or in the snow, he sleeps as warm, dines with as good appetite, and associates as happily as beside his own chimneys.',
'Or perhaps his facility is deeper seated, in the increased range of his faculties of observation, which yield him points of interest wherever fresh objects meet his eyes.',
'The pastoral nations were needy and hungry to desperation; and this intellectual nomadism, in its excess, bankrupts the mind through the dissipation of power on a miscellany of objects.',
'The home-keeping wit, on the other hand, is that continence or content which finds all the elements of life in its own soil; and which has its own perils of monotony and deterioration, if not stimulated by foreign infusions.',
'Every thing the individual sees without him corresponds to his states of mind, and every thing is in turn intelligible to him, as his onward thinking leads him into the truth to which that fact or series belongs.',
'The primeval world,—the Fore-World, as the Germans say,—I can dive to it in myself as well as grope for it with researching fingers in catacombs, libraries, and the broken reliefs and torsos of ruined villas.',
'What is the foundation of that interest all men feel in Greek history, letters, art, and poetry, in all its periods from the Heroic or Homeric age down to the domestic life of the Athenians and Spartans, four or five centuries later?',
'What but this, that every man passes personally through a Grecian period.',
'The Grecian state is the era of the bodily nature, the perfection of the senses,—of the spiritual nature unfolded in strict unity with the body.',
'In it existed those human forms which supplied the sculptor with his models of Hercules, Phœbus, and Jove;',
'not like the forms abounding in the streets of modern cities, wherein the face is a confused blur of features,',
'but composed of incorrupt, sharply defined and symmetrical features, whose eye-sockets are so formed that it would be impossible for such eyes to squint and take furtive glances on this side and on that,',
'but they must turn the whole head.',
'The manners of that period are plain and fierce.',
'The reverence exhibited is for personal qualities; courage, address, self-command, justice, strength, swiftness, a loud voice, a broad chest.',
'Luxury and elegance are not known.',
'A sparse population and want make every man his own valet, cook, butcher and soldier, and the habit of supplying his own needs educates the body to wonderful performances.',
'Such are the Agamemnon and Diomed of Homer, and not far different is the picture Xenophon gives of himself and his compatriots in the Retreat of the Ten Thousand.',
'“After the army had crossed the river Teleboas in Armenia, there fell much snow, and the troops lay miserably on the ground covered with it.',
'But Xenophon arose naked, and taking an axe, began to split wood; whereupon others rose and did the like.”',
'Throughout his army exists a boundless liberty of speech.',
'They quarrel for plunder, they wrangle with the generals on each new order, and Xenophon is as sharp-tongued as any and sharper-tongued than most, and so gives as good as he gets.',
'Who does not see that this is a gang of great boys, with such a code of honor and such lax discipline as great boys have?',
'The costly charm of the ancient tragedy, and indeed of all the old literature, is that the persons speak simply,—speak as persons who have great good sense without knowing it, before yet the reflective habit has become the predominant habit of the mind.',
'Our admiration of the antique is not admiration of the old, but of the natural.',
'The Greeks are not reflective, but perfect in their senses and in their health, with the finest physical organization in the world.',
'Adults acted with the simplicity and grace of children.',
'They made vases, tragedies, and statues, such as healthy senses should,—that is, in good taste.',
'Such things have continued to be made in all ages, and are now, wherever a healthy physique exists; but, as a class, from their superior organization, they have surpassed all.',
'They combine the energy of manhood with the engaging unconsciousness of childhood.',
'The attraction of these manners is that they belong to man, and are known to every man in virtue of his being once a child; besides that there are always individuals who retain these characteristics.',
'A person of childlike genius and inborn energy is still a Greek, and revives our love of the Muse of Hellas.',
'I admire the love of nature in the Philoctetes.',
'In reading those fine apostrophes to sleep, to the stars, rocks, mountains and waves, I feel time passing away as an ebbing sea.',
'I feel the eternity of man, the identity of his thought.',
'The Greek had it seems the same fellow-beings as I.',
'The sun and moon, water and fire, met his heart precisely as they meet mine.',
'Then the vaunted distinction between Greek and English, between Classic and Romantic schools, seems superficial and pedantic.',
'When a thought of Plato becomes a thought to me,—when a truth that fired the soul of Pindar fires mine, time is no more.',
'When I feel that we two meet in a perception, that our two souls are tinged with the same hue, and do as it were run into one, why should I measure degrees of latitude, why should I count Egyptian years?',
'The student interprets the age of chivalry by his own age of chivalry, and the days of maritime adventure and circumnavigation by quite parallel miniature experiences of his own.',
'To the sacred history of the world he has the same key.',
'When the voice of a prophet out of the deeps of antiquity merely echoes to him a sentiment of his infancy, a prayer of his youth, he then pierces to the truth through all the confusion of tradition and the caricature of institutions.',
'Rare, extravagant spirits come by us at intervals, who disclose to us new facts in nature.',
'I see that men of God have from time to time walked among men and made their commission felt in the heart and soul of the commonest hearer.',
'Hence evidently the tripod, the priest, the priestess inspired by the divine afflatus.',
'Jesus astonishes and overpowers sensual people.',
'They cannot unite him to history, or reconcile him with themselves.',
'As they come to revere their intuitions and aspire to live holily, their own piety explains every fact, every word.',
'How easily these old worships of Moses, of Zoroaster, of Menu, of Socrates, domesticate themselves in the mind.',
'I cannot find any antiquity in them.',
'They are mine as much as theirs.',
'I have seen the first monks and anchorets, without crossing seas or centuries.',
'More than once some individual has appeared to me with such negligence of labor and such commanding contemplation, a haughty beneficiary begging in the name of God, as made good to the nineteenth century Simeon the Stylite, the Thebais, and the first Capuchins.',
'The priestcraft of the East and West, of the Magian, Brahmin, Druid, and Inca, is expounded in the individual’s private life.',
'The cramping influence of a hard formalist on a young child, in repressing his spirits and courage, paralyzing the understanding, and that without producing indignation, but only fear and obedience, and even much sympathy with the tyranny,—',
'is a familiar fact, explained to the child when he becomes a man, only by seeing that the oppressor of his youth is himself a child tyrannized over by those names and words and forms of whose influence he was merely the organ to the youth.',
'The fact teaches him how Belus was worshipped and how the Pyramids were built, better than the discovery by Champollion of the names of all the workmen and the cost of every tile.',
'He finds Assyria and the Mounds of Cholula at his door, and himself has laid the courses.',
'Again, in that protest which each considerate person makes against the superstition of his times, he repeats step for step the part of old reformers, and in the search after truth finds, like them, new perils to virtue.',
'He learns again what moral vigor is needed to supply the girdle of a superstition.',
'A great licentiousness treads on the heels of a reformation.',
'How many times in the history of the world has the Luther of the day had to lament the decay of piety in his own household!',
'“Doctor,” said his wife to Martin Luther, one day, “how is it that whilst subject to papacy we prayed so often and with such fervor, whilst now we pray with the utmost coldness and very seldom?”',
'The advancing man discovers how deep a property he has in literature,—in all fable as well as in all history.',
'He finds that the poet was no odd fellow who described strange and impossible situations, but that universal man wrote by his pen a confession true for one and true for all.',
'His own secret biography he finds in lines wonderfully intelligible to him, dotted down before he was born.',
'One after another he comes up in his private adventures with every fable of Æsop, of Homer, of Hafiz, of Ariosto, of Chaucer, of Scott, and verifies them with his own head and hands.',
'The beautiful fables of the Greeks, being proper creations of the imagination and not of the fancy, are universal verities.',
'What a range of meanings and what perpetual pertinence has the story of Prometheus!',
'Beside its primary value as the first chapter of the history of Europe, (the mythology thinly veiling authentic facts, the invention of the mechanic arts and the migration of colonies,) it gives the history of religion, with some closeness to the faith of later ages.',
'Prometheus is the Jesus of the old mythology.',
'He is the friend of man; stands between the unjust “justice” of the Eternal Father and the race of mortals, and readily suffers all things on their account.',
'But where it departs from the Calvinistic Christianity and exhibits him as the defier of Jove,',
'it represents a state of mind which readily appears wherever the doctrine of Theism is taught in a crude, objective form,',
'and which seems the self-defence of man against this untruth, namely a discontent with the believed fact that a God exists,',
'and a feeling that the obligation of reverence is onerous.',

'On my saying, “What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within?” my friend suggested,—“But these impulses may be from below, not from above.”',
'I replied, “They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil’s child, I will live then from the Devil.”',
'No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature.',
'Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution; the only wrong what is against it.',
'A man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition as if every thing were titular and ephemeral but he.',
'I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions.',

'There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I am bought and sold;',
'for them I will go to prison if need be;',
'but your miscellaneous popular charities;',
'the education at college of fools;',
'the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now stand;',
'alms to sots, and the thousand-fold Relief Societies;—though I confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.',
'Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule.',
'There is the man and his virtues.',
'Men do what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade.',

'I know that for myself it makes no difference whether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent.',
'I cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right.',
'Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.',
'What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think.',
'This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness.',
'It is the harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it.',
'It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.',
'The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is that it scatters your force.',
'It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character.',
'If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers,—',
'under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are: and of course so much force is withdrawn from your proper life.',

'A man must consider what a blindman’s-buff is this game of conformity.',
'If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument.',
'I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church.',

'Do I not know that with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution he will do no such thing?',
'Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side, the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister?',
'He is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation.',
'Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion.',
'This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars.',
'Their every truth is not quite true.',
'Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us and we know not where to begin to set them right.',
'Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere.',
'We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression.',
'There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean “the foolish face of praise,” the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest us.',
'The muscles, not spontaneously moved but moved by a low usurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face with the most disagreeable sensation.',
'For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure.',
'And therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face.',
'The by-standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend’s parlor.',
'If this aversation had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own he might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs.',
'Yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college.',
'It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook the rage of the cultivated classes.',
'Their rage is decorous and prudent, for they are timid, as being very vulnerable themselves.',
'But when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added, when the ignorant and the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow,',
'it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.',
'The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.',
'But why should you keep your head over your shoulder?',
'Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place?',
'Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then?',
'It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day.',
'In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity, yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color.',
'Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.',
'A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.',
'With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do.',
'He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall.',
'Speak what you think now in hard words and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.—‘Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.’—Is it so bad then to be misunderstood?',
'Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.',
'To be great is to be misunderstood.',
'I suppose no man can violate his nature.',
'All the sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere.',
'Nor does it matter how you gauge and try him.',
'A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza;—read it forward, backward, or across, it still spells the same thing.',

'The swallow over my window should interweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also.',
'We pass for what we are.',
'Character teaches above our wills.',
'Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment.',
'There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be each honest and natural in their hour.',
'For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike they seem.',
'These varieties are lost sight of at a little distance, at a little height of thought.',
'One tendency unites them all.',
'The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks.',
'See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency.',

'Your conformity explains nothing.',
'Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now.',
'Greatness appeals to the future.',

'A great man is coming to eat at my house.',
'I do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to please me.',
'I will stand here for humanity, and though I would make it kind, I would make it true.',
'Let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face of custom and trade and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works;',
'that a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the centre of things.',
'Where he is, there is nature.',
'He measures you and all men and all events.',
'Ordinarily, every body in society reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person.',
'Character, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes place of the whole creation.',
'The man must be so much that he must make all circumstances indifferent.',
'Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design;—and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients.',
'A man Cæsar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire.',
'Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man.',
'An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man; as, Monachism, of the Hermit Antony; the Reformation, of Luther; Quakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of Wesley; Abolition, of Clarkson.',
'Scipio, Milton called “the height of Rome”; and all history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons.',

'and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke,',
'and assured that he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact that it symbolizes so well the state of man,',
'who is in the world a sort of sot,',
'but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason and finds himself a true prince.',
'Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic.',
'In history our imagination plays us false.',
'Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier vocabulary than private John and Edward in a small house and common day’s work; but the things of life are the same to both; the sum total of both is the same.',

'For the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed.',
'We first share the life by which things exist and afterwards see them as appearances in nature and forget that we have shared their cause.',

'Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due.',

'Thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for they do not distinguish between perception and notion.',

'But perception is not whimsical, but fatal.',
'If I see a trait, my children will see it after me, and in course of time all mankind,—although it may chance that no one has seen it before me.',
'For my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun.',
'The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure that it is profane to seek to interpose helps.',
'It must be that when God speaketh he should communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the world with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the centre of the present thought; and new date and new create the whole.',
'Whenever a mind is simple and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away,—means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour.',
'All things are made sacred by relation to it,—one as much as another.',
'All things are dissolved to their centre by their cause, and in the universal miracle petty and particular miracles disappear.',

'Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less.',
'Its nature is satisfied and it satisfies nature in all moments alike.',
'But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future.',
'He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.',
'This should be plain enough.',
'Yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear God himself unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul.',
'We shall not always set so great a price on a few texts, on a few lives.',
'We are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men of talents and character they chance to see,—painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke;',
'afterwards, when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered these sayings, they understand them and are willing to let the words go;',
'for at any time they can use words as good when occasion comes.',
'If we live truly, we shall see truly.',
'It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak.',

'When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.',
'And now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid; probably cannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off remembering of the intuition.',
'That thought by what I can now nearest approach to say it, is this.',
'When good is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the footprints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall not hear any name;—the way, the thought, the good shall be wholly strange and new.',

'Fear and hope are alike beneath it.',
'There is somewhat low even in hope.',
'In the hour of vision there is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly joy.',
'The soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well.',

'This one fact the world hates; that the soul becomes; for that for ever degrades the past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to a shame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally aside.',
'Why then do we prate of self-reliance?',
'Inasmuch as the soul is present there will be power not confident but agent.',
'To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking.',
'Speak rather of that which relies because it works and is.',
'Who has more obedience than I masters me, though he should not raise his finger.',

'I see the same law working in nature for conservation and growth.',
'Power is, in nature, the essential measure of right.',
'Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself.',

'1. In what prayers do men allow themselves!',
'That which they call a holy office is not so much as brave and manly.',
'Prayer looks abroad and asks for some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue, and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural, and mediatorial and miraculous.',
'Prayer that craves a particular commodity, any thing less than all good, is vicious.',
'Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view.',
'It is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul.',
'It is the spirit of God pronouncing his works good.',

'Every new mind is a new classification.',
'If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power, a Locke, a Lavoisier, a Hutton, a Bentham, a Fourier, it imposes its classification on other men, and lo! a new system.',
'In proportion to the depth of the thought, and so to the number of the objects it touches and brings within reach of the pupil, is his complacency.',
'But chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches, which are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental thought of duty, and man’s relation to the Highest.',
'Such is Calvinism, Quakerism, Swedenborgism.',
'The pupil takes the same delight in subordinating every thing to the new terminology as a girl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth and new seasons thereby.',
'It will happen for a time that the pupil will find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his master’s mind.',
'But in all unbalanced minds the classification is idolized, passes for the end and not for a speedily exhaustible means, so that the walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe;',
'the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their master built.',
'They cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to see,—how you can see; ‘It must be somehow that you stole the light from us.’',

'Let them chirp awhile and call it their own.',
'If they are honest and do well, presently their neat new pinfold will be too strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot and vanish, and the immortal light, all young and joyful, million-orbed, million-colored, will beam over the universe as on the first morning.',
'2. It is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Travelling, whose idols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascination for all educated Americans.',

'In manly hours we feel that duty is our place.',
'The soul is no traveller;',
'the wise man stays at home, and when his necessities, his duties, on any occasion call him from his house, or into foreign lands,',

'It was an application of his own thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed.',
'And why need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model?',
'Beauty, convenience, grandeur of thought and quaint expression are as near to us as to any,',
'and if the American artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done by him, considering the climate, the soil, the length of the day, the wants of the people, the habit and form of the government,',
'he will create a house in which all these will find themselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be satisfied also.',

'Not possibly will the soul, all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign to repeat itself; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in the same pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue are two organs of one nature.',
'Abide in the simple and noble regions of thy life, obey thy heart and thou shalt reproduce the Foreworld again.',
'4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look abroad, so does our spirit of society.',
'All men plume themselves on the improvement of society, and no man improves.',
'Society never advances.',
'It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other.',

'And power to him who power exerts;',
'Hast not thy share?',
'On winged feet,',
'Lo! it rushes thee to meet;',
'And all that Nature made thy own,',
'Floating in air or pent in stone,',
'Will rive the hills and swim the sea',
'And, like thy shadow, follow thee.',
'Ever since I was a boy I have wished to write a discourse on Compensation; for it seemed to me when very young that on this subject life was ahead of theology and the people knew more than the preachers taught.',
'The documents too from which the doctrine is to be drawn, charmed my fancy by their endless variety, and lay always before me, even in sleep;',
'for they are the tools in our hands, the bread in our basket, the transactions of the street, the farm and the dwelling-house;',
'greetings, relations, debts and credits, the influence of character, the nature and endowment of all men.',
'It seemed to me also that in it might be shown men a ray of divinity, the present action of the soul of this world, clean from all vestige of tradition;',
'and so the heart of man might be bathed by an inundation of eternal love, conversing with that which he knows was always and always must be, because it really is now.',
'It appeared moreover that if this doctrine could be stated in terms with any resemblance to those bright intuitions in which this truth is sometimes revealed to us,',
'it would be a star in many dark hours and crooked passages in our journey, that would not suffer us to lose our way.',
'I was lately confirmed in these desires by hearing a sermon at church.',
'The preacher, a man esteemed for his orthodoxy, unfolded in the ordinary manner the doctrine of the Last Judgment.',
'He assumed that judgment is not executed in this world; that the wicked are successful; that the good are miserable; and then urged from reason and from Scripture a compensation to be made to both parties in the next life.',
'No offence appeared to be taken by the congregation at this doctrine.',
'As far as I could observe when the meeting broke up they separated without remark on the sermon.',
'Yet what was the import of this teaching?',
'What did the preacher mean by saying that the good are miserable in the present life?',
'Was it that houses and lands, offices, wine, horses, dress, luxury, are had by unprincipled men, whilst the saints are poor and despised;',
'and that a compensation is to be made to these last hereafter, by giving them the like gratifications another day,—bank-stock and doubloons, venison and champagne?',
'This must be the compensation intended; for what else?',
'Is it that they are to have leave to pray and praise? to love and serve men?',
'Why, that they can do now.',
'The legitimate inference the disciple would draw was,—‘We are to have such a good time as the sinners have now’;—or, to push it to its extreme import,—‘You sin now; we shall sin by and by; we would sin now, if we could; not being successful, we expect our revenge to-morrow.’',
'The fallacy lay in the immense concession that the bad are successful; that justice is not done now.',
'The blindness of the preacher consisted in deferring to the base estimate of the market of what constitutes a manly success, instead of confronting and convicting the world from the truth;',
'announcing the presence of the soul;',
'the omnipotence of the will;',
'and so establishing the standard of good and ill, of success and falsehood.',
'I find a similar base tone in the popular religious works of the day and the same doctrines assumed by the literary men when occasionally they treat the related topics.',
'I think that our popular theology has gained in decorum, and not in principle, over the superstitions it has displaced.',
'But men are better than their theology.',
'Their daily life gives it the lie.',
'Every ingenuous and aspiring soul leaves the doctrine behind him in his own experience, and all men feel sometimes the falsehood which they cannot demonstrate.',
'For men are wiser than they know.',
'That which they hear in schools and pulpits without afterthought, if said in conversation would probably be questioned in silence.',
'If a man dogmatize in a mixed company on Providence and the divine laws, he is answered by a silence which conveys well enough to an observer the dissatisfaction of the hearer, but his incapacity to make his own statement.',
'I shall attempt in this and the following chapter to record some facts that indicate the path of the law of Compensation; happy beyond my expectation if I shall truly draw the smallest arc of this circle.',

'Whilst the world is thus dual, so is every one of its parts.',
'The entire system of things gets represented in every particle.',
'There is somewhat that resembles the ebb and flow of the sea, day and night, man and woman, in a single needle of the pine, in a kernel of corn, in each individual of every animal tribe.',
'The reaction, so grand in the elements, is repeated within these small boundaries.',

'Phidias it is not, but the work of man in that early Hellenic world that I would know.',
'The name and circumstance of Phidias, however convenient for history, embarrass when we come to the highest criticism.',
'We are to see that which man was tending to do in a given period, and was hindered, or, if you will, modified in doing, by the interfering volitions of Phidias, of Dante, of Shakspeare, the organ whereby man at the moment wrought.',

'As no man thoroughly understands a truth until he has contended against it, so no man has a thorough acquaintance with the hindrances or talents of men until he has suffered from the one and seen the triumph of the other over his own want of the same.',
'Has he a defect of temper that unfits him to live in society?',
'Thereby he is driven to entertain himself alone and acquire habits of self-help; and thus, like the wounded oyster, he mends his shell with pearl.',
'Our strength grows out of our weakness.',
'The indignation which arms itself with secret forces does not awaken until we are pricked and stung and sorely assailed.',
'A great man is always willing to be little.',
'Whilst he sits on the cushion of advantages, he goes to sleep.',
'When he is pushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something; he has been put on his wits, on his manhood; he has gained facts; learns his ignorance; is cured of the insanity of conceit; has got moderation and real skill.',
'The wise man throws himself on the side of his assailants.',
'It is more his interest than it is theirs to find his weak point.',
'The wound cicatrizes and falls off from him like a dead skin and when they would triumph, lo! he has passed on invulnerable.',
'Blame is safer than praise.',
'I hate to be defended in a newspaper.',
'As long as all that is said is said against me, I feel a certain assurance of success.',
'But as soon as honeyed words of praise are spoken for me I feel as one that lies unprotected before his enemies.',
'In general, every evil to which we do not succumb is a benefactor.',
'As the Sandwich Islander believes that the strength and valor of the enemy he kills passes into himself, so we gain the strength of the temptation we resist.',
'The same guards which protect us from disaster, defect, and enmity, defend us, if we will, from selfishness and fraud.',
'Bolts and bars are not the best of our institutions, nor is shrewdness in trade a mark of wisdom.',
'Men suffer all their life long under the foolish superstition that they can be cheated.',
'But it is as impossible for a man to be cheated by any one but himself, as for a thing to be and not to be at the same time.',
'There is a third silent party to all our bargains.',
'The nature and soul of things takes on itself the guaranty of the fulfilment of every contract, so that honest service cannot come to loss.',
'If you serve an ungrateful master, serve him the more.',
'Put God in your debt.',
'Every stroke shall be repaid.',
'The longer the payment is withholden, the better for you; for compound interest on compound interest is the rate and usage of this exchequer.',
'The history of persecution is a history of endeavors to cheat nature, to make water run up hill, to twist a rope of sand.',
'It makes no difference whether the actors be many or one, a tyrant or a mob.',
'A mob is a society of bodies voluntarily bereaving themselves of reason and traversing its work.',
'The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast.',
'Its fit hour of activity is night.',
'Its actions are insane like its whole constitution.',
'It persecutes a principle; it would whip a right; it would tar and feather justice, by inflicting fire and outrage upon the houses and persons of those who have these.',
'It resembles the prank of boys, who run with fire-engines to put out the ruddy aurora streaming to the stars.',
'The inviolate spirit turns their spite against the wrongdoers.',
'The martyr cannot be dishonored.',
'Every lash inflicted is a tongue of fame; every prison, a more illustrious abode; every burned book or house enlightens the world; every suppressed or expunged word reverberates through the earth from side to side.',
'Hours of sanity and consideration are always arriving to communities, as to individuals, when the truth is seen and the martyrs are justified.',
'Thus do all things preach the indifferency of circumstances.',
'The man is all.',
'Every thing has two sides, a good and an evil.',
'Every advantage has its tax.',
'I learn to be content.',
'But the doctrine of compensation is not the doctrine of indifferency.',
'The thoughtless say, on hearing these representations,—What boots it to do well? there is one event to good and evil; if I gain any good I must pay for it; if I lose any good I gain some other; all actions are indifferent.',
'There is a deeper fact in the soul than compensation, to wit, its own nature.',
'The soul is not a compensation, but a life.',
'The soul is.',
'Under all this running sea of circumstance, whose waters ebb and flow with perfect balance, lies the aboriginal abyss of real Being.',
'Essence, or God, is not a relation or a part, but the whole.',
'Being is the vast affirmative, excluding negation, self-balanced, and swallowing up all relations, parts and times within itself.',
'Nature, truth, virtue, are the influx from thence.',
'Vice is the absence or departure of the same.',
'Nothing, Falsehood, may indeed stand as the great Night or shade on which as a background the living universe paints itself forth, but no fact is begotten by it; it cannot work, for it is not.',
'It cannot work any good; it cannot work any harm.',
'It is harm inasmuch as it is worse not to be than to be.',
'We feel defrauded of the retribution due to evil acts, because the criminal adheres to his vice and contumacy and does not come to a crisis or judgment anywhere in visible nature.',
'There is no stunning confutation of his nonsense before men and angels.',
'Has he therefore outwitted the law?',
'Inasmuch as he carries the malignity and the lie with him he so far deceases from nature.',
'In some manner there will be a demonstration of the wrong to the understanding also; but, should we not see it, this deadly deduction makes square the eternal account.',
'Neither can it be said, on the other hand, that the gain of rectitude must be bought by any loss.',
'There is no penalty to virtue; no penalty to wisdom; they are proper additions of being.',
'In a virtuous action I properly am; in a virtuous act I add to the world; I plant into deserts conquered from Chaos and Nothing and see the darkness receding on the limits of the horizon.',
'There can be no excess to love, none to knowledge, none to beauty, when these attributes are considered in the purest sense.',
'The soul refuses limits, and always affirms an Optimism, never a Pessimism.',
'His life is a progress, and not a station.',
'His instinct is trust.',
'Our instinct uses “more” and “less” in application to man, of the presence of the soul, and not of its absence, the brave man is greater than the coward; the true, the benevolent, the wise, is more a man and not less, than the fool and knave.',
'There is no tax on the good of virtue, for that is the incoming of God himself, or absolute existence, without any comparative.',
'Material good has its tax, and if it came without desert or sweat, has no root in me, and the next wind will blow it away.',
'But all the good of nature is the soul’s, and may be had if paid for in nature’s lawful coin, that is, by labor which the heart and the head allow.',
'I no longer wish to meet a good I do not earn, for example to find a pot of buried gold, knowing that it brings with it new burdens.',
'I do not wish more external goods,—neither possessions, nor honors, nor powers, nor persons.',
'The gain is apparent; the tax is certain.',
'But there is no tax on the knowledge that the compensation exists and that it is not desirable to dig up treasure.',
'Herein I rejoice with a serene eternal peace.',
'I contract the boundaries of possible mischief.',
'I learn the wisdom of St. Bernard,—“Nothing can work me damage except myself; the harm that I sustain I carry about with me, and never am a real sufferer but by my own fault.”',
'In the nature of the soul is the compensation for the inequalities of condition.',
'The radical tragedy of nature seems to be the distinction of More and Less.',
'How can Less not feel the pain; how not feel indignation or malevolence towards More?',
'Look at those who have less faculty, and one feels sad and knows not well what to make of it.',
'He almost shuns their eye; he fears they will upbraid God.',
'What should they do?',
'It seems a great injustice.',
'But see the facts nearly and these mountainous inequalities vanish.',
'Love reduces them as the sun melts the iceberg in the sea.',
'The heart and soul of all men being one, this bitterness of His and Mine ceases.',
'His is mine.',
'I am my brother and my brother is me.',
'If I feel overshadowed and outdone by great neighbors, I can yet love; I can still receive; and he that loveth maketh his own the grandeur he loves.',
'Thereby I make the discovery that my brother is my guardian, acting for me with the friendliest designs, and the estate I so admired and envied is my own.',
'It is the nature of the soul to appropriate all things.',
'Jesus and Shakspeare are fragments of the soul, and by love I conquer and incorporate them in my own conscious domain.',
'His virtue,—is not that mine?',
'His wit,—if it cannot be made mine, it is not wit.',
'Such also is the natural history of calamity.',
'The changes which break up at short intervals the prosperity of men are advertisements of a nature whose law is growth.',
'Every soul is by this intrinsic necessity quitting its whole system of things, its friends and home and laws and faith, as the shell-fish crawls out of its beautiful but stony case, because it no longer admits of its growth, and slowly forms a new house.',
'In proportion to the vigor of the individual these revolutions are frequent,',
'until in some happier mind they are incessant and all worldly relations hang very loosely about him, becoming as it were a transparent fluid membrane through which the living form is seen, and not,',
'as in most men, an indurated heterogeneous fabric of many dates and of no settled character, in which the man is imprisoned.',
'Then there can be enlargement, and the man of to-day scarcely recognizes the man of yesterday.',
'And such should be the outward biography of man in time, a putting off of dead circumstances day by day, as he renews his raiment day by day.',
'But to us, in our lapsed estate, resting, not advancing, resisting, not cooperating with the divine expansion, this growth comes by shocks.',
'We cannot part with our friends.',
'We cannot let our angels go.',
'We do not see that they only go out that archangels may come in.',
'We are idolaters of the old.',
'We do not believe in the riches of the soul, in its proper eternity and omnipresence.',
'We do not believe there is any force in to-day to rival or recreate that beautiful yesterday.',
'We linger in the ruins of the old tent where once we had bread and shelter and organs, nor believe that the spirit can feed, cover, and nerve us again.',
'We cannot again find aught so dear, so sweet, so graceful.',
'But we sit and weep in vain.',
'The voice of the Almighty saith, ‘Up and onward for evermore!’',
'We cannot stay amid the ruins.',
'Neither will we rely on the new; and so we walk ever with reverted eyes, like those monsters who look backwards.',
'And yet the compensations of calamity are made apparent to the understanding also, after long intervals of time.',
'A fever, a mutilation, a cruel disappointment, a loss of wealth, a loss of friends, seems at the moment unpaid loss, and unpayable.',
'But the sure years reveal the deep remedial force that underlies all facts.',
'The death of a dear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius;',
'for it commonly operates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up a wonted occupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character.',
'It permits or constrains the formation of new acquaintances and the reception of new influences that prove of the first importance to the next years;',
'and the man or woman who would have remained a sunny garden-flower, with no room for its roots and too much sunshine for its head, by the falling of the walls and the neglect of the gardener is made the banian of the forest, yielding shade and fruit to wide neighborhoods of men.',

'When the act of reflection takes place in the mind, when we look at ourselves in the light of thought, we discover that our life is embosomed in beauty.',
'Behind us, as we go, all things assume pleasing forms, as clouds do far off.',
'Not only things familiar and stale, but even the tragic and terrible are comely as they take their place in the pictures of memory.',
'The river-bank, the weed at the water-side, the old house, the foolish person, however neglected in the passing, have a grace in the past.',
'Even the corpse that has lain in the chambers has added a solemn ornament to the house.',
'The soul will not know either deformity or pain.',
'If in the hours of clear reason we should speak the severest truth, we should say that we had never made a sacrifice.',
'In these hours the mind seems so great that nothing can be taken from us that seems much.',

'Neither vexations nor calamities abate our trust.',
'No man ever stated his griefs as lightly as he might.',
'Allow for exaggeration in the most patient and sorely ridden hack that ever was driven.',

'The intellectual life may be kept clean and healthful if man will live the life of nature and not import into his mind difficulties which are none of his.',
'No man need be perplexed in his speculations.',
'Let him do and say what strictly belongs to him, and though very ignorant of books, his nature shall not yield him any intellectual obstructions and doubts.',
'Our young people are diseased with the theological problems of original sin, origin of evil, predestination and the like.',
'These never presented a practical difficulty to any man,—never darkened across any man’s road who did not go out of his way to seek them.',
'These are the soul’s mumps and measles and whooping-coughs, and those who have not caught them cannot describe their health or prescribe the cure.',
'A simple mind will not know these enemies.',
'It is quite another thing that he should be able to give account of his faith and expound to another the theory of his self-union and freedom.',
'This requires rare gifts.',
'Yet without this self-knowledge there may be a sylvan strength and integrity in that which he is.',
'“A few strong instincts and a few plain rules” suffice us.',
'My will never gave the images in my mind the rank they now take.',
'The regular course of studies, the years of academical and professional education have not yielded me better facts than some idle books under the bench at the Latin School.',
'What we do not call education is more precious than that which we call so.',
'We form no guess, at the time of receiving a thought, of its comparative value.',
'And education often wastes its effort in attempts to thwart and balk this natural magnetism, which is sure to select what belongs to it.',
'In like manner our moral nature is vitiated by any interference of our will.',
'People represent virtue as a struggle, and take to themselves great airs upon their attainments, and the question is everywhere vexed when a noble nature is commended, whether the man is not better who strives with temptation.',
'But there is no merit in the matter.',
'Either God is there or he is not there.',
'We love characters in proportion as they are impulsive and spontaneous.',
'The less a man thinks or knows about his virtues the better we like him.',
'Timoleon’s victories are the best victories, which ran and flowed like Homer’s verses, Plutarch said.',
'When we see a soul whose acts are all regal, graceful and pleasant as roses, we must thank God that such things can be and are, and not turn sourly on the angel and say ‘Crump is a better man with his grunting resistance to all his native devils.’',
'Not less conspicuous is the preponderance of nature over will in all practical life.',
'There is less intention in history than we ascribe to it.',
'We impute deep-laid far-sighted plans to Cæsar and Napoleon; but the best of their power was in nature, not in them.',
'Men of an extraordinary success, in their honest moments, have always sung, ‘Not unto us, not unto us.’',
'According to the faith of their times they have built altars to Fortune, or to Destiny, or to St. Julian.',
'Their success lay in their parallelism to the course of thought, which found in them an unobstructed channel; and the wonders of which they were the visible conductors seemed to the eye their deed.',
'Did the wires generate the galvanism?',
'It is even true that there was less in them on which they could reflect than in another; as the virtue of a pipe is to be smooth and hollow.',
'That which externally seemed will and immovableness was willingness and self-annihilation.',
'Could Shakspeare give a theory of Shakspeare?',
'Could ever a man of prodigious mathematical genius convey to others any insight into his methods?',
'If he could communicate that secret it would instantly lose its exaggerated value, blending with the daylight and the vital energy the power to stand and to go.',
'The lesson is forcibly taught by these observations that our life might be much easier and simpler than we make it;',
'that the world might be a happier place than it is;',
'that there is no need of struggles, convulsions, and despairs, of the wringing of the hands and the gnashing of the teeth;',
'that we miscreate our own evils.',
'We interfere with the optimism of nature; for whenever we get this vantage-ground of the past, or of a wiser mind in the present, we are able to discern that we are begirt with laws which execute themselves.',
'The face of external nature teaches the same lesson.',
'Nature will not have us fret and fume.',
'She does not like our benevolence or our learning much better than she likes our frauds and wars.',
'When we come out of the caucus, or the bank, or the Abolition-convention, or the Temperance-meeting, or the Transcendental club into the fields and woods, she says to us, ‘So hot? my little Sir.’',
'We are full of mechanical actions.',
'We must needs intermeddle and have things in our own way, until the sacrifices and virtues of society are odious.',
'Love should make joy; but our benevolence is unhappy.',
'Our Sunday-schools and churches and pauper-societies are yokes to the neck.',
'We pain ourselves to please nobody.',
'There are natural ways of arriving at the same ends at which these aim, but do not arrive.',
'Why should all virtue work in one and the same way?',
'Why should all give dollars?',
'It is very inconvenient to us country folk, and we do not think any good will come of it.',
'We have not dollars; merchants have; let them give them.',
'Farmers will give corn; poets will sing; women will sew; laborers will lend a hand; the children will bring flowers.',
'And why drag this dead weight of a Sunday-school over the whole Christendom?',
'It is natural and beautiful that childhood should inquire and maturity should teach; but it is time enough to answer questions when they are asked.',
'Do not shut up the young people against their will in a pew and force the children to ask them questions for an hour against their will.',
'If we look wider, things are all alike; laws and letters and creeds and modes of living seem a travesty of truth.',
'Our society is encumbered by ponderous machinery, which resembles the endless aqueducts which the Romans built over hill and dale and which are superseded by the discovery of the law that water rises to the level of its source.',
'It is a Chinese wall which any nimble Tartar can leap over.',
'It is a standing army, not so good as a peace.',
'It is a graduated, titled, richly appointed empire, quite superfluous when town-meetings are found to answer just as well.',
'Let us draw a lesson from nature, which always works by short ways.',
'When the fruit is ripe, it falls.',
'When the fruit is despatched, the leaf falls.',
'The circuit of the waters is mere falling.',
'The walking of man and all animals is a falling forward.',
'All our manual labor and works of strength, as prying, splitting, digging, rowing and so forth, are done by dint of continual falling, and the globe, earth, moon, comet, sun, star, fall for ever and ever.',
'The simplicity of the universe is very different from the simplicity of a machine.',
'He who sees moral nature out and out and thoroughly knows how knowledge is acquired and character formed, is a pedant.',
'The simplicity of nature is not that which may easily be read, but is inexhaustible.',
'The last analysis can no wise be made.',
'We judge of a man’s wisdom by his hope, knowing that the perception of the inexhaustibleness of nature is an immortal youth.',
'The wild fertility of nature is felt in comparing our rigid names and reputations with our fluid consciousness.',
'We pass in the world for sects and schools, for erudition and piety, and we are all the time jejune babes.',
'One sees very well how Pyrrhonism grew up.',
'Every man sees that he is that middle point whereof every thing may be affirmed and denied with equal reason.',
'He is old, he is young, he is very wise, he is altogether ignorant.',
'He hears and feels what you say of the seraphim, and of the tin-peddler.',
'There is no permanent wise man except in the figment of the Stoics.',
'We side with the hero, as we read or paint, against the coward and the robber; but we have been ourselves that coward and robber, and shall be again,—not in the low circumstance, but in comparison with the grandeurs possible to the soul.',
'A little consideration of what takes place around us every day would show us that a higher law than that of our will regulates events;',
'that our painful labors are unnecessary and fruitless;',
'that only in our easy, simple, spontaneous action are we strong, and by contenting ourselves with obedience we become divine.',
'Belief and love,—a believing love will relieve us of a vast load of care.',
'O my brothers, God exists.',
'There is a soul at the centre of nature and over the will of every man, so that none of us can wrong the universe.',
'It has so infused its strong enchantment into nature that we prosper when we accept its advice, and when we struggle to wound its creatures our hands are glued to our sides, or they beat our own breasts.',
'The whole course of things goes to teach us faith.',
'We need only obey.',
'There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening we shall hear the right word.',
'Why need you choose so painfully your place and occupation and associates and modes of action and of entertainment?',
'Certainly there is a possible right for you that precludes the need of balance and wilful election.',
'For you there is a reality, a fit place and congenial duties.',
'Place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which animates all whom it floats, and you are without effort impelled to truth, to right and a perfect contentment.',
'Then you put all gainsayers in the wrong.',
'Then you are the world, the measure of right, of truth, of beauty.',
'If we will not be mar-plots with our miserable interferences, the work, the society, letters, arts, science, religion of men would go on far better than now,',
'and the heaven predicted from the beginning of the world,',
'and still predicted from the bottom of the heart, would organize itself,',
'as do now the rose and the air and the sun.',
'I say, do not choose; but that is a figure of speech by which I would distinguish what is commonly called choice among men, and which is a partial act, the choice of the hands, of the eyes, of the appetites, and not a whole act of the man.',
'But that which I call right or goodness, is the choice of my constitution; and that which I call heaven, and inwardly aspire after, is the state or circumstance desirable to my constitution; and the action which I in all my years tend to do, is the work for my faculties.',
'We must hold a man amenable to reason for the choice of his daily craft or profession.',
'It is not an excuse any longer for his deeds that they are the custom of his trade.',
'What business has he with an evil trade?',
'Has he not a calling in his character?',
'Each man has his own vocation.',
'The talent is the call.',
'There is one direction in which all space is open to him.',
'He has faculties silently inviting him thither to endless exertion.',
'He is like a ship in a river; he runs against obstructions on every side but one, on that side all obstruction is taken away and he sweeps serenely over a deepening channel into an infinite sea.',
'This talent and this call depend on his organization, or the mode in which the general soul incarnates itself in him.',
'He inclines to do something which is easy to him and good when it is done, but which no other man can do.',
'He has no rival.',
'For the more truly he consults his own powers, the more difference will his work exhibit from the work of any other.',
'His ambition is exactly proportioned to his powers.',
'The height of the pinnacle is determined by the breadth of the base.',
'Every man has this call of the power to do somewhat unique, and no man has any other call.',
'The pretence that he has another call, a summons by name and personal election and outward “signs that mark him extraordinary,',
'and not in the roll of common men,” is fanaticism,',
'and betrays obtuseness to perceive that there is one mind in all the individuals,',
'and no respect of persons therein.',
'By doing his work he makes the need felt which he can supply, and creates the taste by which he is enjoyed.',
'By doing his own work he unfolds himself.',
'It is the vice of our public speaking that it has not abandonment.',
'Somewhere, not only every orator but every man should let out all the length of all the reins; should find or make a frank and hearty expression of what force and meaning is in him.',
'The common experience is that the man fits himself as well as he can to the customary details of that work or trade he falls into, and tends it as a dog turns a spit.',
'Then is he a part of the machine he moves; the man is lost.',
'Until he can manage to communicate himself to others in his full stature and proportion, he does not yet find his vocation.',
'He must find in that an outlet for his character, so that he may justify his work to their eyes.',
'If the labor is mean, let him by his thinking and character make it liberal.',
'Whatever he knows and thinks, whatever in his apprehension is worth doing, that let him communicate, or men will never know and honor him aright.',
'Foolish, whenever you take the meanness and formality of that thing you do, instead of converting it into the obedient spiracle of your character and aims.',
'We like only such actions as have already long had the praise of men, and do not perceive that any thing man can do may be divinely done.',
'We think greatness entailed or organized in some places or duties,',
'in certain offices or occasions,',
'and do not see that Paganini can extract rapture from a catgut,',
'and Eulenstein from a jews-harp,',
'and a nimble-fingered lad out of shreds of paper with his scissors,',
'and Landseer out of swine,',
'and the hero out of the pitiful habitation and company in which he was hidden.',
'What we call obscure condition or vulgar society is that condition and society whose poetry is not yet written, but which you shall presently make as enviable and renowned as any.',
'In our estimates let us take a lesson from kings.',
'The parts of hospitality, the connection of families, the impressiveness of death, and a thousand other things, royalty makes its own estimate of, and a royal mind will.',
'To make habitually a new estimate,—that is elevation.',
'What a man does, that he has.',
'What has he to do with hope or fear?',
'In himself is his might.',
'Let him regard no good as solid but that which is in his nature and which must grow out of him as long as he exists.',
'The goods of fortune may come and go like summer leaves; let him scatter them on every wind as the momentary signs of his infinite productiveness.',
'He may have his own.',
'A man’s genius, the quality that differences him from every other, the susceptibility to one class of influences, the selection of what is fit for him, the rejection of what is unfit, determines for him the character of the universe.',
'A man is a method, a progressive arrangement; a selecting principle, gathering his like to him wherever he goes.',
'He takes only his own out of the multiplicity that sweeps and circles round him.',
'He is like one of those booms which are set out from the shore on rivers to catch drift-wood, or like the loadstone amongst splinters of steel.',
'Those facts, words, persons, which dwell in his memory without his being able to say why, remain because they have a relation to him not less real for being as yet unapprehended.',
'They are symbols of value to him as they can interpret parts of his consciousness which he would vainly seek words for in the conventional images of books and other minds.',
'What attracts my attention shall have it, as I will go to the man who knocks at my door, whilst a thousand persons as worthy go by it, to whom I give no regard.',
'It is enough that these particulars speak to me.',
'A few anecdotes, a few traits of character, manners, face, a few incidents, have an emphasis in your memory out of all proportion to their apparent significance if you measure them by the ordinary standards.',
'They relate to your gift.',
'Let them have their weight, and do not reject them and cast about for illustration and facts more usual in literature.',
'What your heart thinks great is great.',
'The soul’s emphasis is always right.',
'Over all things that are agreeable to his nature and genius the man has the highest right.',
'Everywhere he may take what belongs to his spiritual estate, nor can he take any thing else though all doors were open, nor can all the force of men hinder him from taking so much.',
'It is vain to attempt to keep a secret from one who has a right to know it.',
'It will tell itself.',
'That mood into which a friend can bring us is his dominion over us.',
'To the thoughts of that state of mind he has a right.',
'All the secrets of that state of mind he can compel.',
'This is a law which statesmen use in practice.',
'All the terrors of the French Republic, which held Austria in awe, were unable to command her diplomacy.',
'But Napoleon sent to Vienna M. de Narbonne, one of the old noblesse, with the morals, manners and name of that interest, saying that it was indispensable to send to the old aristocracy of Europe men of the same connection, which, in fact, constitutes a sort of free-masonry.',
'M. de Narbonne in less than a fortnight penetrated all the secrets of the imperial cabinet.',
'Nothing seems so easy as to speak and to be understood.',
'Yet a man may come to find that the strongest of defences and of ties,—that he has been understood; and he who has received an opinion may come to find it the most inconvenient of bonds.',
'If a teacher have any opinion which he wishes to conceal, his pupils will become as fully indoctrinated into that as into any which he publishes.',
'If you pour water into a vessel twisted into coils and angles, it is vain to say, I will pour it only into this or that;—it will find its level in all.',
'Men feel and act the consequences of your doctrine without being able to show how they follow.',
'Show us an arc of the curve, and a good mathematician will find out the whole figure.',
'We are always reasoning from the seen to the unseen.',
'Hence the perfect intelligence that subsists between wise men of remote ages.',
'A man cannot bury his meanings so deep in his book but time and like-minded men will find them.',
'Plato had a secret doctrine, had he?',
'What secret can he conceal from the eyes of Bacon? of Montaigne? of Kant?',
'Therefore, Aristotle said of his works, “They are published and not published.”',
'No man can learn what he has not preparation for learning, however near to his eyes is the object.',
'A chemist may tell his most precious secrets to a carpenter, and he shall be never the wiser,—the secrets he would not utter to a chemist for an estate.',
'God screens us evermore from premature ideas.',
'Our eyes are holden that we cannot see things that stare us in the face, until the hour arrives when the mind is ripened; then we behold them, and the time when we saw them not is like a dream.',
'Not in nature but in man is all the beauty and worth he sees.',
'The world is very empty, and is indebted to this gilding, exalting soul for all its pride.',
'“Earth fills her lap with splendors” not her own.',
'The vale of Tempe, Tivoli and Rome are earth and water, rocks and sky.',
'There are as good earth and water in a thousand places, yet how unaffecting!',

'The effect of any writing on the public mind is mathematically measurable by its depth of thought.',
'How much water does it draw?',

'But real action is in silent moments.',
'The epochs of our life are not in the visible facts of our choice of a calling, our marriage, our acquisition of an office, and the like, but in a silent thought by the way-side as we walk;',
'in a thought which revises our entire manner of life and says,—‘Thus hast thou done, but it were better thus.’',
'And all our after years, like menials, serve and wait on this, and according to their ability execute its will.',
'This revisal or correction is a constant force, which, as a tendency, reaches through our lifetime.',

'If the poet write a true drama, then he is Cæsar, and not the player of Cæsar;',
'then the selfsame strain of thought, emotion as pure, wit as subtle, motions as swift, mounting, extravagant, and a heart as great, self-sufficing, dauntless,',
'which on the waves of its love and hope can uplift all that is reckoned solid and precious in the world,—',
'palaces, gardens, money, navies, kingdoms,—',
'marking its own incomparable worth by the slight it casts on these gauds of men;—these all are his, and by the power of these he rouses the nations.',
'Let a man believe in God, and not in names and places and persons.',
'Let the great soul incarnated in some woman’s form, poor and sad and single, in some Dolly or Joan, go out to service, and sweep chambers and scour floors, and its effulgent daybeams cannot be muffled or hid,',
'but to sweep and scour will instantly appear supreme and beautiful actions, the top and radiance of human life, and all people will get mops and brooms;',

'Koran.',
'Every promise of the soul has innumerable fulfilments; each of its joys ripens into a new want.',
'Nature, uncontainable, flowing, forelooking, in the first sentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which shall lose all particular regards in its general light.',
'The introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one, which is the enchantment of human life;',
'which, like a certain divine rage and enthusiasm, seizes on man at one period and works a revolution in his mind and body;',
'unites him to his race, pledges him to the domestic and civic relations, carries him with new sympathy into nature, enhances the power of the senses, opens the imagination, adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes, establishes marriage,',
'and gives permanence to human society.',
'The natural association of the sentiment of love with the heyday of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints, which every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience, one must not be too old.',
'The delicious fancies of youth reject the least savor of a mature philosophy, as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom.',
'And therefore I know I incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those who compose the Court and Parliament of Love.',
'But from these formidable censors I shall appeal to my seniors.',
'For it is to be considered that this passion of which we speak, though it begin with the young,',
'yet forsakes not the old, or rather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old, but makes the aged participators of it not less than the tender maiden, though in a different and nobler sort.',
'For it is a fire that kindling its first embers in the narrow nook of a private bosom, caught from a wandering spark out of another private heart, glows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women, upon the universal heart of all,',
'and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames.',
'It matters not therefore whether we attempt to describe the passion at twenty, at thirty, or at eighty years.',
'He who paints it at the first period will lose some of its later, he who paints it at the last, some of its earlier traits.',
'Only it is to be hoped that by patience and the Muses’ aid we may attain to that inward view of the law which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful, so central that it shall commend itself to the eye, at whatever angle beholden.',
'And the first condition is, that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts, and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in history.',
'For each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured, as the life of man is not, to his imagination.',
'Each man sees over his own experience a certain stain of error, whilst that of other men looks fair and ideal.',
'Let any man go back to those delicious relations which make the beauty of his life, which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment, he will shrink and moan.',
'Alas!',
'I know not why, but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name.',
'Every thing is beautiful seen from the point of the intellect, or as truth.',
'But all is sour, if seen as experience.',
'Details are melancholy; the plan is seemly and noble.',
'In the actual world—the painful kingdom of time and place—dwell care, and canker, and fear.',
'With thought, with the ideal, is immortal hilarity, the rose of joy.',
'Round it all the Muses sing.',
'But grief cleaves to names, and persons, and the partial interests of to-day and yesterday.',
'The strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society.',
'What do we wish to know of any worthy person so much, as how he has sped in the history of this sentiment?',
'What books in the circulating libraries circulate?',
'How we glow over these novels of passion, when the story is told with any spark of truth and nature!',
'And what fastens attention, in the intercourse of life, like any passage betraying affection between two parties?',
'Perhaps we never saw them before, and never shall meet them again.',
'But we see them exchange a glance, or betray a deep emotion, and we are no longer strangers.',
'We understand them, and take the warmest interest in the development of the romance.',
'All mankind love a lover.',
'The earliest demonstrations of complacency and kindness are nature’s most winning pictures.',
'It is the dawn of civility and grace in the coarse and rustic.',
'The rude village boy teases the girls about the school-house door;—but to-day he comes running into the entry, and meets one fair child disposing her satchel;',
'he holds her books to help her, and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely, and was a sacred precinct.',
'Among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough, but one alone distances him; and these two little neighbors, that were so close just now, have learned to respect each other’s personality.',
'Or who can avert his eyes from the engaging, half-artful, half-artless ways of school-girls who go into the country shops to buy a skein of silk or a sheet of paper, and talk half an hour about nothing with the broad-faced, good-natured shop-boy.',
'In the village they are on a perfect equality, which love delights in, and without any coquetry the happy, affectionate nature of woman flows out in this pretty gossip.',
'The girls may have little beauty, yet plainly do they establish between them and the good boy the most agreeable, confiding relations,',
'what with their fun and their earnest, about Edgar and Jonas and Almira, and who was invited to the party, and who danced at the dancing-school, and when the singing-school would begin, and other nothings concerning which the parties cooed.',
'By and by that boy wants a wife, and very truly and heartily will he know where to find a sincere and sweet mate, without any risk such as Milton deplores as incident to scholars and great men.',
'I have been told that in some public discourses of mine my reverence for the intellect has made me unjustly cold to the personal relations.',
'But now I almost shrink at the remembrance of such disparaging words.',
'For persons are love’s world, and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wandering here in nature to the power of love, without being tempted to unsay, as treasonable to nature, aught derogatory to the social instincts.',
'For though the celestial rapture falling out of heaven seizes only upon those of tender age, and although a beauty overpowering all analysis or comparison and putting us quite beside ourselves we can seldom see after thirty years,',
'yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances, and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows.',
'But here is a strange fact;',
'it may seem to many men, in revising their experience, that they have no fairer page in their life’s book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection contrived to give a witchcraft, surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth,',
'to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances.',
'In looking backward they may find that several things which were not the charm have more reality to this groping memory than the charm itself which embalmed them.',
'But be our experience in particulars what it may, no man ever forgot the visitations of that power to his heart and brain, which created all things anew;',
'which was the dawn in him of music, poetry, and art;',
'which made the face of nature radiant with purple light, the morning and the night varied enchantments;',
'when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound, and the most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory;',
'when he became all eye when one was present, and all memory when one was gone;',
'when the youth becomes a watcher of windows and studious of a glove, a veil, a ribbon, or the wheels of a carriage;',
'when no place is too solitary and none too silent, for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than any old friends, though best and purest, can give him;',
'for the figures, the motions, the words of the beloved object are not like other images written in water, but, as Plutarch said, “enamelled in fire,” and make the study of midnight:—',
'“Thou art not gone being gone, where’er thou art,',
'Thou leav’st in him thy watchful eyes, in him thy loving heart.”',
'In the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recollection of days when happiness was not happy enough, but must be drugged with the relish of pain and fear; for he touched the secret of the matter who said of love,—',
'“All other pleasures are not worth its pains:”',
'and when the day was not long enough, but the night too must be consumed in keen recollections;',
'when the head boiled all night on the pillow with the generous deed it resolved on;',
'when the moonlight was a pleasing fever and the stars were letters and the flowers ciphers and the air was coined into song;',
'when all business seemed an impertinence, and all the men and women running to and fro in the streets, mere pictures.',
'The passion rebuilds the world for the youth.',
'It makes all things alive and significant.',
'Nature grows conscious.',
'Every bird on the boughs of the tree sings now to his heart and soul.',
'The notes are almost articulate.',
'The clouds have faces as he looks on them.',
'The trees of the forest, the waving grass and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent; and he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to invite.',
'Yet nature soothes and sympathizes.',
'In the green solitude he finds a dearer home than with men:—',
'“Fountain-heads and pathless groves,',
'Places which pale passion loves,',
'Moonlight walks, when all the fowls',
'Are safely housed, save bats and owls,',
'A midnight bell, a passing groan,—',
'These are the sounds we feed upon.”',
'Behold there in the wood the fine madman!',
'He is a palace of sweet sounds and sights; he dilates; he is twice a man; he walks with arms akimbo; he soliloquizes; he accosts the grass and the trees; he feels the blood of the violet, the clover and the lily in his veins; and he talks with the brook that wets his foot.',
'The heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love music and verse.',
'It is a fact often observed, that men have written good verses under the inspiration of passion, who cannot write well under any other circumstances.',
'The like force has the passion over all his nature.',
'It expands the sentiment; it makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart.',
'Into the most pitiful and abject it will infuse a heart and courage to defy the world, so only it have the countenance of the beloved object.',
'In giving him to another it still more gives him to himself.',
'He is a new man, with new perceptions, new and keener purposes, and a religious solemnity of character and aims.',
'He does not longer appertain to his family and society; he is somewhat; he is a person; he is a soul.',
'And here let us examine a little nearer the nature of that influence which is thus potent over the human youth.',
'Beauty, whose revelation to man we now celebrate, welcome as the sun wherever it pleases to shine, which pleases everybody with it and with themselves, seems sufficient to itself.',
'The lover cannot paint his maiden to his fancy poor and solitary.',
'Like a tree in flower, so much soft, budding, informing loveliness is society for itself; and she teaches his eye why Beauty was pictured with Loves and Graces attending her steps.',
'Her existence makes the world rich.',
'Though she extrudes all other persons from his attention as cheap and unworthy, she indemnifies him by carrying out her own being into somewhat impersonal, large, mundane, so that the maiden stands to him for a representative of all select things and virtues.',
'For that reason the lover never sees personal resemblances in his mistress to her kindred or to others.',
'His friends find in her a likeness to her mother, or her sisters, or to persons not of her blood.',
'The lover sees no resemblance except to summer evenings and diamond mornings, to rainbows and the song of birds.',
'The ancients called beauty the flowering of virtue.',
'Who can analyze the nameless charm which glances from one and another face and form?',
'We are touched with emotions of tenderness and complacency, but we cannot find whereat this dainty emotion, this wandering gleam, points.',
'It is destroyed for the imagination by any attempt to refer it to organization.',
'Nor does it point to any relations of friendship or love known and described in society, but, as it seems to me, to a quite other and unattainable sphere, to relations of transcendent delicacy and sweetness, to what roses and violets hint and foreshow.',
'We cannot approach beauty.',
'Its nature is like opaline doves’-neck lustres, hovering and evanescent.',
'Herein it resembles the most excellent things, which all have this rainbow character, defying all attempts at appropriation and use.',
'What else did Jean Paul Richter signify, when he said to music, “Away! away! thou speakest to me of things which in all my endless life I have not found, and shall not find.”',
'The same fluency may be observed in every work of the plastic arts.',
'The statue is then beautiful when it begins to be incomprehensible, when it is passing out of criticism and can no longer be defined by compass and measuring-wand, but demands an active imagination to go with it and to say what it is in the act of doing.',
'The god or hero of the sculptor is always represented in a transition from that which is representable to the senses, to that which is not.',
'Then first it ceases to be a stone.',
'The same remark holds of painting.',
'And of poetry the success is not attained when it lulls and satisfies, but when it astonishes and fires us with new endeavors after the unattainable.',
'Concerning it Landor inquires “whether it is not to be referred to some purer state of sensation and existence.”',
'In like manner, personal beauty is then first charming and itself when it dissatisfies us with any end;',
'when it becomes a story without an end;',
'when it suggests gleams and visions and not earthly satisfactions;',
'when it makes the beholder feel his unworthiness;',
'when he cannot feel his right to it, though he were Cæsar;',
'he cannot feel more right to it than to the firmament and the splendors of a sunset.',
'Hence arose the saying, “If I love you, what is that to you?”',
'We say so because we feel that what we love is not in your will, but above it.',
'It is not you, but your radiance.',
'It is that which you know not in yourself and can never know.',
'This agrees well with that high philosophy of Beauty which the ancient writers delighted in;',
'for they said that the soul of man, embodied here on earth, went roaming up and down in quest of that other world of its own out of which it came into this, but was soon stupefied by the light of the natural sun, and unable to see any other objects than those of this world,',
'which are but shadows of real things.',
'Therefore the Deity sends the glory of youth before the soul, that it may avail itself of beautiful bodies as aids to its recollection of the celestial good and fair;',
'and the man beholding such a person in the female sex runs to her and finds the highest joy in contemplating the form, movement, and intelligence of this person, because it suggests to him the presence of that which indeed is within the beauty, and the cause of the beauty.',
'If however, from too much conversing with material objects, the soul was gross, and misplaced its satisfaction in the body, it reaped nothing but sorrow;',
'body being unable to fulfil the promise which beauty holds out;',
'but if, accepting the hint of these visions and suggestions which beauty makes to his mind, the soul passes through the body and falls to admire strokes of character,',
'and the lovers contemplate one another in their discourses and their actions, then they pass to the true palace of beauty, more and more inflame their love of it,',
'and by this love extinguishing the base affection,',
'as the sun puts out the fire by shining on the hearth, they become pure and hallowed.',
'By conversation with that which is in itself excellent, magnanimous, lowly, and just, the lover comes to a warmer love of these nobilities, and a quicker apprehension of them.',
'Then he passes from loving them in one to loving them in all, and so is the one beautiful soul only the door through which he enters to the society of all true and pure souls.',
'In the particular society of his mate he attains a clearer sight of any spot, any taint which her beauty has contracted from this world, and is able to point it out, and this with mutual joy that they are now able, without offence,',
'to indicate blemishes and hindrances in each other, and give to each all help and comfort in curing the same.',
'And beholding in many souls the traits of the divine beauty, and separating in each soul that which is divine from the taint which it has contracted in the world, the lover ascends to the highest beauty,',
'to the love and knowledge of the Divinity, by steps on this ladder of created souls.',
'Somewhat like this have the truly wise told us of love in all ages.',
'The doctrine is not old, nor is it new.',
'If Plato, Plutarch and Apuleius taught it, so have Petrarch, Angelo and Milton.',
'It awaits a truer unfolding in opposition and rebuke to that subterranean prudence which presides at marriages with words that take hold of the upper world, whilst one eye is prowling in the cellar; so that its gravest discourse has a savor of hams and powdering-tubs.',
'Worst, when this sensualism intrudes into the education of young women, and withers the hope and affection of human nature by teaching that marriage signifies nothing but a housewife’s thrift, and that woman’s life has no other aim.',
'But this dream of love, though beautiful, is only one scene in our play.',
'In the procession of the soul from within outward, it enlarges its circles ever, like the pebble thrown into the pond, or the light proceeding from an orb.',
'The rays of the soul alight first on things nearest, on every utensil and toy, on nurses and domestics, on the house and yard and passengers, on the circle of household acquaintance, on politics and geography and history.',
'But things are ever grouping themselves according to higher or more interior laws.',
'Neighborhood, size, numbers, habits, persons, lose by degrees their power over us.',
'Cause and effect, real affinities, the longing for harmony between the soul and the circumstance, the progressive, idealizing instinct, predominate later, and the step backward from the higher to the lower relations is impossible.',
'Thus even love, which is the deification of persons, must become more impersonal every day.',
'Of this at first it gives no hint.',
'Little think the youth and maiden who are glancing at each other across crowded rooms with eyes so full of mutual intelligence, of the precious fruit long hereafter to proceed from this new, quite external stimulus.',
'The work of vegetation begins first in the irritability of the bark and leaf-buds.',
'From exchanging glances, they advance to acts of courtesy, of gallantry, then to fiery passion, to plighting troth and marriage.',
'Passion beholds its object as a perfect unit.',
'The soul is wholly embodied, and the body is wholly ensouled:—',
'“Her pure and eloquent blood',
'Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought,',
'That one might almost say her body thought.”',
'Romeo, if dead, should be cut up into little stars to make the heavens fine.',
'Life, with this pair, has no other aim, asks no more, than Juliet,—than Romeo.',
'Night, day, studies, talents, kingdoms, religion, are all contained in this form full of soul, in this soul which is all form.',
'The lovers delight in endearments, in avowals of love, in comparisons of their regards.',
'When alone, they solace themselves with the remembered image of the other.',
'Does that other see the same star, the same melting cloud, read the same book, feel the same emotion, that now delight me?',
'They try and weigh their affection, and adding up costly advantages, friends, opportunities, properties, exult in discovering that willingly, joyfully, they would give all as a ransom for the beautiful, the beloved head, not one hair of which shall be harmed.',
'But the lot of humanity is on these children.',
'Danger, sorrow, and pain arrive to them, as to all.',
'Love prays.',
'It makes covenants with Eternal Power in behalf of this dear mate.',
'The union which is thus effected and which adds a new value to every atom in nature—for it transmutes every thread throughout the whole web of relation into a golden ray, and bathes the soul in a new and sweeter element—is yet a temporary state.',
'Not always can flowers, pearls, poetry, protestations, nor even home in another heart, content the awful soul that dwells in clay.',
'It arouses itself at last from these endearments, as toys, and puts on the harness and aspires to vast and universal aims.',
'The soul which is in the soul of each, craving a perfect beatitude, detects incongruities, defects and disproportion in the behavior of the other.',
'Hence arise surprise, expostulation and pain.',
'Yet that which drew them to each other was signs of loveliness, signs of virtue; and these virtues are there, however eclipsed.',
'They appear and reappear and continue to attract; but the regard changes, quits the sign and attaches to the substance.',
'This repairs the wounded affection.',
'Meantime, as life wears on, it proves a game of permutation and combination of all possible positions of the parties, to employ all the resources of each and acquaint each with the strength and weakness of the other.',
'For it is the nature and end of this relation, that they should represent the human race to each other.',
'All that is in the world, which is or ought to be known, is cunningly wrought into the texture of man, of woman:—',
'“The person love does to us fit,',
'Like manna, has the taste of all in it.”',
'The world rolls; the circumstances vary every hour.',
'The angels that inhabit this temple of the body appear at the windows, and the gnomes and vices also.',
'By all the virtues they are united.',
'If there be virtue, all the vices are known as such; they confess and flee.',
'Their once flaming regard is sobered by time in either breast, and losing in violence what it gains in extent, it becomes a thorough good understanding.',
'They resign each other without complaint to the good offices which man and woman are severally appointed to discharge in time, and exchange the passion which once could not lose sight of its object,',
'for a cheerful, disengaged furtherance, whether present or absent, of each other’s designs.',
'At last they discover that all which at first drew them together,—those once sacred features, that magical play of charms,—was deciduous, had a prospective end, like the scaffolding by which the house was built;',
'and the purification of the intellect and the heart from year to year is the real marriage, foreseen and prepared from the first, and wholly above their consciousness.',
'Looking at these aims with which two persons, a man and a woman,',
'so variously and correlatively gifted, are shut up in one house to spend in the nuptial society forty or fifty years,',
'I do not wonder at the emphasis with which the heart prophesies this crisis from early infancy, at the profuse beauty with which the instincts deck the nuptial bower,',
'and nature and intellect and art emulate each other in the gifts and the melody they bring to the epithalamium.',
'Thus are we put in training for a love which knows not sex, nor person, nor partiality, but which seeks virtue and wisdom everywhere, to the end of increasing virtue and wisdom.',
'We are by nature observers, and thereby learners.',
'That is our permanent state.',
'But we are often made to feel that our affections are but tents of a night.',
'Though slowly and with pain, the objects of the affections change, as the objects of thought do.',
'There are moments when the affections rule and absorb the man and make his happiness dependent on a person or persons.',
'But in health the mind is presently seen again,—its overarching vault, bright with galaxies of immutable lights, and the warm loves and fears that swept over us as clouds must lose their finite character and blend with God, to attain their own perfection.',
'But we need not fear that we can lose any thing by the progress of the soul.',
'The soul may be trusted to the end.',
'That which is so beautiful and attractive as these relations, must be succeeded and supplanted only by what is more beautiful, and so on for ever.',
'VI: FRIENDSHIP',
'A ruddy drop of manly blood',
'The surging sea outweighs;',
'The world uncertain comes and goes,',
'The lover rooted stays.',
'I fancied he was fled,',
'And, after many a year,',
'Glowed unexhausted kindliness',
'Like daily sunrise there.',
'My careful heart was free again,—',
'O friend, my bosom said,',
'Through thee alone the sky is arched,',
'Through thee the rose is red,',
'All things through thee take nobler form',
'And look beyond the earth,',
'The mill-round of our fate appears',
'A sun-path in thy worth.',
'Me too thy nobleness has taught',
'To master my despair;',
'The fountains of my hidden life',
'Are through thy friendship fair.',
'We have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken.',
'Maugre all the selfishness that chills like east winds the world, the whole human family is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether.',
'How many persons we meet in houses, whom we scarcely speak to, whom yet we honor, and who honor us!',
'How many we see in the street, or sit with in church, whom, though silently, we warmly rejoice to be with!',
'Read the language of these wandering eye-beams.',
'The heart knoweth.',
'The effect of the indulgence of this human affection is a certain cordial exhilaration.',
'In poetry and in common speech, the emotions of benevolence and complacency which are felt towards others are likened to the material effects of fire; so swift, or much more swift, more active, more cheering, are these fine inward irradiations.',
'From the highest degree of passionate love to the lowest degree of good-will, they make the sweetness of life.',
'Our intellectual and active powers increase with our affection.',
'The scholar sits down to write, and all his years of meditation do not furnish him with one good thought or happy expression; but it is necessary to write a letter to a friend,—and forthwith troops of gentle thoughts invest themselves, on every hand, with chosen words.',
'See, in any house where virtue and self-respect abide, the palpitation which the approach of a stranger causes.',
'A commended stranger is expected and announced, and an uneasiness betwixt pleasure and pain invades all the hearts of a household.',
'His arrival almost brings fear to the good hearts that would welcome him.',
'The house is dusted, all things fly into their places, the old coat is exchanged for the new, and they must get up a dinner if they can.',
'Of a commended stranger, only the good report is told by others, only the good and new is heard by us.',
'He stands to us for humanity.',
'He is what we wish.',
'Having imagined and invested him, we ask how we should stand related in conversation and action with such a man, and are uneasy with fear.',
'The same idea exalts conversation with him.',
'We talk better than we are wont.',
'We have the nimblest fancy, a richer memory, and our dumb devil has taken leave for the time.',
'For long hours we can continue a series of sincere, graceful, rich communications, drawn from the oldest, secretest experience, so that they who sit by, of our own kinsfolk and acquaintance, shall feel a lively surprise at our unusual powers.',
'But as soon as the stranger begins to intrude his partialities, his definitions, his defects, into the conversation, it is all over.',
'He has heard the first, the last and best he will ever hear from us.',
'He is no stranger now.',
'Vulgarity, ignorance, misapprehension are old acquaintances.',
'Now, when he comes, he may get the order, the dress and the dinner,—but the throbbing of the heart and the communications of the soul, no more.',
'What is so pleasant as these jets of affection which make a young world for me again?',
'What so delicious as a just and firm encounter of two, in a thought, in a feeling?',
'How beautiful, on their approach to this beating heart, the steps and forms of the gifted and the true!',
'The moment we indulge our affections, the earth is metamorphosed; there is no winter and no night; all tragedies, all ennuis vanish,—all duties even; nothing fills the proceeding eternity but the forms all radiant of beloved persons.',
'Let the soul be assured that somewhere in the universe it should rejoin its friend, and it would be content and cheerful alone for a thousand years.',
'I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old and the new.',
'Shall I not call God the Beautiful, who daily showeth himself so to me in his gifts?',
'I chide society, I embrace solitude, and yet I am not so ungrateful as not to see the wise, the lovely and the noble-minded, as from time to time they pass my gate.',
'Who hears me, who understands me, becomes mine,—a possession for all time.',
'Nor is Nature so poor but she gives me this joy several times, and thus we weave social threads of our own, a new web of relations;',
'and, as many thoughts in succession substantiate themselves, we shall by and by stand in a new world of our own creation, and no longer strangers and pilgrims in a traditionary globe.',
'My friends have come to me unsought.',
'The great God gave them to me.',
'By oldest right, by the divine affinity of virtue with itself, I find them, or rather not I but the Deity in me and in them derides and cancels the thick walls of individual character, relation, age, sex, circumstance, at which he usually connives, and now makes many one.',
'High thanks I owe you, excellent lovers, who carry out the world for me to new and noble depths, and enlarge the meaning of all my thoughts.',
'These are new poetry of the first Bard,—poetry without stop,—hymn, ode and epic, poetry still flowing, Apollo and the Muses chanting still.',
'Will these too separate themselves from me again, or some of them?',
'I know not, but I fear it not; for my relation to them is so pure, that we hold by simple affinity, and the Genius of my life being thus social, the same affinity will exert its energy on whomsoever is as noble as these men and women, wherever I may be.',
'I confess to an extreme tenderness of nature on this point.',
'It is almost dangerous to me to “crush the sweet poison of misused wine” of the affections.',
'A new person is to me a great event and hinders me from sleep.',
'I have often had fine fancies about persons which have given me delicious hours; but the joy ends in the day; it yields no fruit.',
'Thought is not born of it; my action is very little modified.',
'I must feel pride in my friend’s accomplishments as if they were mine, and a property in his virtues.',
'I feel as warmly when he is praised, as the lover when he hears applause of his engaged maiden.',
'We over-estimate the conscience of our friend.',
'His goodness seems better than our goodness, his nature finer, his temptations less.',
'Every thing that is his,—his name, his form, his dress, books and instruments,—fancy enhances.',
'Our own thought sounds new and larger from his mouth.',
'Yet the systole and diastole of the heart are not without their analogy in the ebb and flow of love.',
'Friendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too good to be believed.',
'The lover, beholding his maiden, half knows that she is not verily that which he worships; and in the golden hour of friendship we are surprised with shades of suspicion and unbelief.',
'We doubt that we bestow on our hero the virtues in which he shines, and afterwards worship the form to which we have ascribed this divine inhabitation.',
'In strictness, the soul does not respect men as it respects itself.',
'In strict science all persons underlie the same condition of an infinite remoteness.',
'Shall we fear to cool our love by mining for the metaphysical foundation of this Elysian temple?',
'Shall I not be as real as the things I see?',
'If I am, I shall not fear to know them for what they are.',
'Their essence is not less beautiful than their appearance, though it needs finer organs for its apprehension.',
'The root of the plant is not unsightly to science, though for chaplets and festoons we cut the stem short.',
'And I must hazard the production of the bald fact amidst these pleasing reveries, though it should prove an Egyptian skull at our banquet.',
'A man who stands united with his thought conceives magnificently of himself.',
'He is conscious of a universal success, even though bought by uniform particular failures.',
'No advantages, no powers, no gold or force, can be any match for him.',
'I cannot choose but rely on my own poverty more than on your wealth.',
'I cannot make your consciousness tantamount to mine.',
'Only the star dazzles; the planet has a faint, moon-like ray.',
'I hear what you say of the admirable parts and tried temper of the party you praise, but I see well that for all his purple cloaks I shall not like him, unless he is at last a poor Greek like me.',
'I cannot deny it, O friend, that the vast shadow of the Phenomenal includes thee also in its pied and painted immensity,—thee also, compared with whom all else is shadow.',
'Thou art not Being, as Truth is, as Justice is,—thou art not my soul, but a picture and effigy of that.',
'Thou hast come to me lately, and already thou art seizing thy hat and cloak.',
'Is it not that the soul puts forth friends as the tree puts forth leaves, and presently, by the germination of new buds, extrudes the old leaf?',
'The law of nature is alternation for evermore.',
'Each electrical state superinduces the opposite.',
'The soul environs itself with friends that it may enter into a grander self-acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone for a season, that it may exalt its conversation or society.',
'This method betrays itself along the whole history of our personal relations.',
'The instinct of affection revives the hope of union with our mates, and the returning sense of insulation recalls us from the chase.',
'Thus every man passes his life in the search after friendship, and if he should record his true sentiment, he might write a letter like this to each new candidate for his love:—',
'DEAR FRIEND,',
'If I was sure of thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match my mood with thine, I should never think again of trifles in relation to thy comings and goings.',
'I am not very wise; my moods are quite attainable, and I respect thy genius; it is to me as yet unfathomed; yet dare I not presume in thee a perfect intelligence of me, and so thou art to me a delicious torment.',
'Thine ever, or never.',
'Yet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity and not for life.',
'They are not to be indulged.',
'This is to weave cobweb, and not cloth.',
'Our friendships hurry to short and poor conclusions, because we have made them a texture of wine and dreams, instead of the tough fibre of the human heart.',
'The laws of friendship are austere and eternal, of one web with the laws of nature and of morals.',
'But we have aimed at a swift and petty benefit, to suck a sudden sweetness.',
'We snatch at the slowest fruit in the whole garden of God, which many summers and many winters must ripen.',
'We seek our friend not sacredly, but with an adulterate passion which would appropriate him to ourselves.',
'In vain.',
'We are armed all over with subtle antagonisms, which, as soon as we meet, begin to play, and translate all poetry into stale prose.',
'Almost all people descend to meet.',
'All association must be a compromise, and, what is worst, the very flower and aroma of the flower of each of the beautiful natures disappears as they approach each other.',
'What a perpetual disappointment is actual society, even of the virtuous and gifted!',
'After interviews have been compassed with long foresight we must be tormented presently by baffled blows, by sudden, unseasonable apathies, by epilepsies of wit and of animal spirits, in the heyday of friendship and thought.',
'Our faculties do not play us true, and both parties are relieved by solitude.',
'I ought to be equal to every relation.',
'It makes no difference how many friends I have and what content I can find in conversing with each, if there be one to whom I am not equal.',
'If I have shrunk unequal from one contest, the joy I find in all the rest becomes mean and cowardly.',
'I should hate myself, if then I made my other friends my asylum:—',
'“The valiant warrior famoused for fight,',
'After a hundred victories, once foiled,',
'Is from the book of honor razed quite,',
'And all the rest forgot for which he toiled.”',
'Our impatience is thus sharply rebuked.',
'Bashfulness and apathy are a tough husk in which a delicate organization is protected from premature ripening.',
'It would be lost if it knew itself before any of the best souls were yet ripe enough to know and own it.',
'Respect the naturlangsamkeit which hardens the ruby in a million years, and works in duration in which Alps and Andes come and go as rainbows.',
'The good spirit of our life has no heaven which is the price of rashness.',
'Love, which is the essence of God, is not for levity, but for the total worth of man.',
'Let us not have this childish luxury in our regards, but the austerest worth; let us approach our friend with an audacious trust in the truth of his heart, in the breadth, impossible to be overturned, of his foundations.',
'The attractions of this subject are not to be resisted, and I leave, for the time, all account of subordinate social benefit, to speak of that select and sacred relation which is a kind of absolute, and which even leaves the language of love suspicious and common,',
'so much is this purer, and nothing is so much divine.',
'I do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with roughest courage.',
'When they are real, they are not glass threads or frostwork, but the solidest thing we know.',
'For now, after so many ages of experience, what do we know of nature or of ourselves?',
'Not one step has man taken toward the solution of the problem of his destiny.',
'In one condemnation of folly stand the whole universe of men.',
'But the sweet sincerity of joy and peace which I draw from this alliance with my brother’s soul is the nut itself whereof all nature and all thought is but the husk and shell.',
'Happy is the house that shelters a friend!',
'It might well be built, like a festal bower or arch, to entertain him a single day.',
'Happier, if he know the solemnity of that relation and honor its law!',
'He who offers himself a candidate for that covenant comes up, like an Olympian, to the great games where the first-born of the world are the competitors.',
'He proposes himself for contests where Time, Want, Danger, are in the lists, and he alone is victor who has truth enough in his constitution to preserve the delicacy of his beauty from the wear and tear of all these.',
'The gifts of fortune may be present or absent, but all the speed in that contest depends on intrinsic nobleness and the contempt of trifles.',
'There are two elements that go to the composition of friendship, each so sovereign that I can detect no superiority in either, no reason why either should be first named.',
'One is truth.',
'A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere.',
'Before him I may think aloud.',
'I am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal that I may drop even those undermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and second thought,',
'which men never put off, and may deal with him with the simplicity and wholeness with which one chemical atom meets another.',
'Sincerity is the luxury allowed, like diadems and authority, only to the highest rank; that being permitted to speak truth, as having none above it to court or conform unto.',
'Every man alone is sincere.',
'At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy begins.',
'We parry and fend the approach of our fellow-man by compliments, by gossip, by amusements, by affairs.',
'We cover up our thought from him under a hundred folds.',
'I knew a man who under a certain religious frenzy cast off this drapery, and omitting all compliment and commonplace, spoke to the conscience of every person he encountered, and that with great insight and beauty.',
'At first he was resisted, and all men agreed he was mad.',
'But persisting—as indeed he could not help doing—for some time in this course, he attained to the advantage of bringing every man of his acquaintance into true relations with him.',
'No man would think of speaking falsely with him, or of putting him off with any chat of markets or reading-rooms.',
'But every man was constrained by so much sincerity to the like plaindealing, and what love of nature, what poetry, what symbol of truth he had, he did certainly show him.',
'But to most of us society shows not its face and eye, but its side and its back.',
'To stand in true relations with men in a false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not?',
'We can seldom go erect.',
'Almost every man we meet requires some civility,—requires to be humored; he has some fame, some talent, some whim of religion or philanthropy in his head that is not to be questioned, and which spoils all conversation with him.',
'But a friend is a sane man who exercises not my ingenuity, but me.',
'My friend gives me entertainment without requiring any stipulation on my part.',
'A friend therefore is a sort of paradox in nature.',
'I who alone am, I who see nothing in nature whose existence I can affirm with equal evidence to my own, behold now the semblance of my being, in all its height, variety, and curiosity, reiterated in a foreign form; so that a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature.',
'The other element of friendship is tenderness.',
'We are holden to men by every sort of tie, by blood, by pride, by fear, by hope, by lucre, by lust, by hate, by admiration, by every circumstance and badge and trifle,—but we can scarce believe that so much character can subsist in another as to draw us by love.',
'Can another be so blessed and we so pure that we can offer him tenderness?',
'When a man becomes dear to me I have touched the goal of fortune.',
'I find very little written directly to the heart of this matter in books.',
'And yet I have one text which I cannot choose but remember.',
'My author says,—“I offer myself faintly and bluntly to those whose I effectually am, and tender myself least to him to whom I am the most devoted.”',
'I wish that friendship should have feet, as well as eyes and eloquence.',
'It must plant itself on the ground, before it vaults over the moon.',
'I wish it to be a little of a citizen, before it is quite a cherub.',
'We chide the citizen because he makes love a commodity.',
'It is an exchange of gifts, of useful loans; it is good neighborhood; it watches with the sick; it holds the pall at the funeral; and quite loses sight of the delicacies and nobility of the relation.',
'But though we cannot find the god under this disguise of a sutler, yet on the other hand we cannot forgive the poet if he spins his thread too fine and does not substantiate his romance by the municipal virtues of justice, punctuality, fidelity and pity.',
'I hate the prostitution of the name of friendship to signify modish and worldly alliances.',
'I much prefer the company of ploughboys and tin-peddlers to the silken and perfumed amity which celebrates its days of encounter by a frivolous display, by rides in a curricle and dinners at the best taverns.',
'The end of friendship is a commerce the most strict and homely that can be joined; more strict than any of which we have experience.',
'It is for aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of life and death.',
'It is fit for serene days and graceful gifts and country rambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare, shipwreck, poverty, and persecution.',
'It keeps company with the sallies of the wit and the trances of religion.',
'We are to dignify to each other the daily needs and offices of man’s life, and embellish it by courage, wisdom and unity.',
'It should never fall into something usual and settled, but should be alert and inventive and add rhyme and reason to what was drudgery.',
'Friendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly, each so well tempered and so happily adapted, and withal so circumstanced (for even in that particular, a poet says, love demands that the parties be altogether paired),',
'that its satisfaction can very seldom be assured.',
'It cannot subsist in its perfection, say some of those who are learned in this warm lore of the heart, betwixt more than two.',
'I am not quite so strict in my terms, perhaps because I have never known so high a fellowship as others.',
'I please my imagination more with a circle of godlike men and women variously related to each other and between whom subsists a lofty intelligence.',
'But I find this law of one to one peremptory for conversation, which is the practice and consummation of friendship.',
'Do not mix waters too much.',
'The best mix as ill as good and bad.',
'You shall have very useful and cheering discourse at several times with two several men, but let all three of you come together and you shall not have one new and hearty word.',
'Two may talk and one may hear, but three cannot take part in a conversation of the most sincere and searching sort.',
'In good company there is never such discourse between two, across the table, as takes place when you leave them alone.',
'In good company the individuals merge their egotism into a social soul exactly co-extensive with the several consciousnesses there present.',
'No partialities of friend to friend, no fondnesses of brother to sister, of wife to husband, are there pertinent, but quite otherwise.',
'Only he may then speak who can sail on the common thought of the party, and not poorly limited to his own.',
'Now this convention, which good sense demands, destroys the high freedom of great conversation, which requires an absolute running of two souls into one.',
'No two men but being left alone with each other enter into simpler relations.',
'Yet it is affinity that determines which two shall converse.',
'Unrelated men give little joy to each other, will never suspect the latent powers of each.',
'We talk sometimes of a great talent for conversation, as if it were a permanent property in some individuals.',
'Conversation is an evanescent relation,—no more.',
'A man is reputed to have thought and eloquence; he cannot, for all that, say a word to his cousin or his uncle.',
'They accuse his silence with as much reason as they would blame the insignificance of a dial in the shade.',
'In the sun it will mark the hour.',
'Among those who enjoy his thought he will regain his tongue.',
'Friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and unlikeness that piques each with the presence of power and of consent in the other party.',
'Let me be alone to the end of the world, rather than that my friend should overstep, by a word or a look, his real sympathy.',
'I am equally balked by antagonism and by compliance.',
'Let him not cease an instant to be himself.',
'The only joy I have in his being mine, is that the not mine is mine.',
'I hate, where I looked for a manly furtherance, or at least a manly resistance, to find a mush of concession.',
'Better be a nettle in the side of your friend than his echo.',
'The condition which high friendship demands is ability to do without it.',
'That high office requires great and sublime parts.',
'There must be very two, before there can be very one.',
'Let it be an alliance of two large, formidable natures, mutually beheld, mutually feared, before yet they recognize the deep identity which, beneath these disparities, unites them.',
'He only is fit for this society who is magnanimous; who is sure that greatness and goodness are always economy; who is not swift to intermeddle with his fortunes.',
'Let him not intermeddle with this.',
'Leave to the diamond its ages to grow, nor expect to accelerate the births of the eternal.',
'Friendship demands a religious treatment.',
'We talk of choosing our friends, but friends are self-elected.',
'Reverence is a great part of it.',
'Treat your friend as a spectacle.',
'Of course he has merits that are not yours, and that you cannot honor if you must needs hold him close to your person.',
'Stand aside; give those merits room; let them mount and expand.',
'Are you the friend of your friend’s buttons, or of his thought?',
'To a great heart he will still be a stranger in a thousand particulars, that he may come near in the holiest ground.',
'Leave it to girls and boys to regard a friend as property, and to suck a short and all-confounding pleasure, instead of the noblest benefit.',
'Let us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation.',
'Why should we desecrate noble and beautiful souls by intruding on them?',
'Why insist on rash personal relations with your friend?',
'Why go to his house, or know his mother and brother and sisters?',
'Why be visited by him at your own?',
'Are these things material to our covenant?',
'Leave this touching and clawing.',
'Let him be to me a spirit.',
'A message, a thought, a sincerity, a glance from him, I want, but not news, nor pottage.',
'I can get politics and chat and neighborly conveniences from cheaper companions.',
'Should not the society of my friend be to me poetic, pure, universal and great as nature itself?',
'Ought I to feel that our tie is profane in comparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the horizon, or that clump of waving grass that divides the brook?',
'Let us not vilify, but raise it to that standard.',
'That great defying eye, that scornful beauty of his mien and action, do not pique yourself on reducing, but rather fortify and enhance.',
'Worship his superiorities; wish him not less by a thought, but hoard and tell them all.',
'Guard him as thy counterpart.',
'Let him be to thee for ever a sort of beautiful enemy, untamable, devoutly revered, and not a trivial conveniency to be soon outgrown and cast aside.',
'The hues of the opal, the light of the diamond, are not to be seen if the eye is too near.',
'To my friend I write a letter and from him I receive a letter.',
'That seems to you a little.',
'It suffices me.',
'It is a spiritual gift worthy of him to give and of me to receive.',
'It profanes nobody.',
'In these warm lines the heart will trust itself, as it will not to the tongue, and pour out the prophecy of a godlier existence than all the annals of heroism have yet made good.',
'Respect so far the holy laws of this fellowship as not to prejudice its perfect flower by your impatience for its opening.',
'We must be our own before we can be another’s.',
'There is at least this satisfaction in crime, according to the Latin proverb;—you can speak to your accomplice on even terms.',
'Crimen quos inquinat, æquat.',
'To those whom we admire and love, at first we cannot.',
'Yet the least defect of self-possession vitiates, in my judgment, the entire relation.',
'There can never be deep peace between two spirits, never mutual respect, until in their dialogue each stands for the whole world.',
'What is so great as friendship, let us carry with what grandeur of spirit we can.',
'Let us be silent,—so we may hear the whisper of the gods.',
'Let us not interfere.',
'Who set you to cast about what you should say to the select souls, or how to say any thing to such?',
'No matter how ingenious, no matter how graceful and bland.',
'There are innumerable degrees of folly and wisdom, and for you to say aught is to be frivolous.',
'Wait, and thy heart shall speak.',
'Wait until the necessary and everlasting overpowers you, until day and night avail themselves of your lips.',
'The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have a friend is to be one.',
'You shall not come nearer a man by getting into his house.',
'If unlike, his soul only flees the faster from you, and you shall never catch a true glance of his eye.',
'We see the noble afar off and they repel us; why should we intrude?',
'Late,—very late,—we perceive that no arrangements, no introductions, no consuetudes or habits of society would be of any avail to establish us in such relations with them as we desire,—but solely the uprise of nature in us to the same degree it is in them;',
'then shall we meet as water with water;',
'and if we should not meet them then, we shall not want them, for we are already they.',
'In the last analysis, love is only the reflection of a man’s own worthiness from other men.',
'Men have sometimes exchanged names with their friends, as if they would signify that in their friend each loved his own soul.',
'The higher the style we demand of friendship, of course the less easy to establish it with flesh and blood.',
'We walk alone in the world.',
'Friends such as we desire are dreams and fables.',
'But a sublime hope cheers ever the faithful heart, that elsewhere, in other regions of the universal power, souls are now acting, enduring, and daring, which can love us and which we can love.',
'We may congratulate ourselves that the period of nonage, of follies, of blunders and of shame, is passed in solitude, and when we are finished men we shall grasp heroic hands in heroic hands.',
'Only be admonished by what you already see, not to strike leagues of friendship with cheap persons, where no friendship can be.',
'Our impatience betrays us into rash and foolish alliances which no god attends.',
'By persisting in your path, though you forfeit the little you gain the great.',
'You demonstrate yourself, so as to put yourself out of the reach of false relations, and you draw to you the first-born of the world,—those rare pilgrims whereof only one or two wander in nature at once, and before whom the vulgar great show as spectres and shadows merely.',
'It is foolish to be afraid of making our ties too spiritual, as if so we could lose any genuine love.',
'Whatever correction of our popular views we make from insight, nature will be sure to bear us out in, and though it seem to rob us of some joy, will repay us with a greater.',
'Let us feel if we will the absolute insulation of man.',
'We are sure that we have all in us.',
'We go to Europe, or we pursue persons, or we read books, in the instinctive faith that these will call it out and reveal us to ourselves.',
'Beggars all.',
'The persons are such as we; the Europe, an old faded garment of dead persons; the books, their ghosts.',
'Let us drop this idolatry.',
'Let us give over this mendicancy.',
'Let us even bid our dearest friends farewell, and defy them, saying, ‘Who are you?',
'Unhand me: I will be dependent no more.’',
'Ah! seest thou not, O brother, that thus we part only to meet again on a higher platform, and only be more each other’s because we are more our own?',
'A friend is Janus-faced; he looks to the past and the future.',
'He is the child of all my foregoing hours, the prophet of those to come, and the harbinger of a greater friend.',
'I do then with my friends as I do with my books.',
'I would have them where I can find them, but I seldom use them.',
'We must have society on our own terms, and admit or exclude it on the slightest cause.',
'I cannot afford to speak much with my friend.',
'If he is great he makes me so great that I cannot descend to converse.',
'In the great days, presentiments hover before me in the firmament.',
'I ought then to dedicate myself to them.',
'I go in that I may seize them, I go out that I may seize them.',
'I fear only that I may lose them receding into the sky in which now they are only a patch of brighter light.',
'Then, though I prize my friends, I cannot afford to talk with them and study their visions, lest I lose my own.',
'It would indeed give me a certain household joy to quit this lofty seeking, this spiritual astronomy or search of stars, and come down to warm sympathies with you; but then I know well I shall mourn always the vanishing of my mighty gods.',
'It is true, next week I shall have languid moods, when I can well afford to occupy myself with foreign objects; then I shall regret the lost literature of your mind, and wish you were by my side again.',
'But if you come, perhaps you will fill my mind only with new visions; not with yourself but with your lustres, and I shall not be able any more than now to converse with you.',
'So I will owe to my friends this evanescent intercourse.',
'I will receive from them not what they have but what they are.',
'They shall give me that which properly they cannot give, but which emanates from them.',
'But they shall not hold me by any relations less subtile and pure.',
'We will meet as though we met not, and part as though we parted not.',
'It has seemed to me lately more possible than I knew, to carry a friendship greatly, on one side, without due correspondence on the other.',
'Why should I cumber myself with regrets that the receiver is not capacious?',
'It never troubles the sun that some of his rays fall wide and vain into ungrateful space, and only a small part on the reflecting planet.',
'Let your greatness educate the crude and cold companion.',
'If he is unequal he will presently pass away; but thou art enlarged by thy own shining, and no longer a mate for frogs and worms, dost soar and burn with the gods of the empyrean.',
'It is thought a disgrace to love unrequited.',
'But the great will see that true love cannot be unrequited.',
'True love transcends the unworthy object and dwells and broods on the eternal, and when the poor interposed mask crumbles, it is not sad, but feels rid of so much earth and feels its independency the surer.',
'Yet these things may hardly be said without a sort of treachery to the relation.',
'The essence of friendship is entireness, a total magnanimity and trust.',
'It must not surmise or provide for infirmity.',
'It treats its object as a god, that it may deify both.',
'VII: PRUDENCE',
'Theme no poet gladly sung,',
'Fair to old and foul to young;',
'Scorn not thou the love of parts,',
'And the articles of arts.',
'Grandeur of the perfect sphere',
'Thanks the atoms that cohere.',
'What right have I to write on Prudence, whereof I have Little, and that of the negative sort?',
'My prudence consists in avoiding and going without, not in the inventing of means and methods, not in adroit steering, not in gentle repairing.',
'I have no skill to make money spend well, no genius in my economy, and whoever sees my garden discovers that I must have some other garden.',
'Yet I love facts, and hate lubricity and people without perception.',
'Then I have the same title to write on prudence that I have to write on poetry or holiness.',
'We write from aspiration and antagonism, as well as from experience.',
'We paint those qualities which we do not possess.',
'The poet admires the man of energy and tactics; the merchant breeds his son for the church or the bar; and where a man is not vain and egotistic you shall find what he has not by his praise.',
'Moreover it would be hardly honest in me not to balance these fine lyric words of Love and Friendship with words of coarser sound, and whilst my debt to my senses is real and constant, not to own it in passing.',
'Prudence is the virtue of the senses.',
'It is the science of appearances.',
'It is the outmost action of the inward life.',
'It is God taking thought for oxen.',
'It moves matter after the laws of matter.',
'It is content to seek health of body by complying with physical conditions, and health of mind by the laws of the intellect.',
'The world of the senses is a world of shows;',
'it does not exist for itself, but has a symbolic character;',
'and a true prudence or law of shows recognizes the co-presence of other laws and knows that its own office is subaltern;',
'knows that it is surface and not centre where it works.',
'Prudence is false when detached.',
'It is legitimate when it is the Natural History of the soul incarnate, when it unfolds the beauty of laws within the narrow scope of the senses.',
'There are all degrees of proficiency in knowledge of the world.',
'It is sufficient to our present purpose to indicate three.',
'One class live to the utility of the symbol, esteeming health and wealth a final good.',
'Another class live above this mark to the beauty of the symbol, as the poet and artist and the naturalist and man of science.',
'A third class live above the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the thing signified; these are wise men.',
'The first class have common sense; the second, taste; and the third, spiritual perception.',
'Once in a long time, a man traverses the whole scale, and sees and enjoys the symbol solidly, then also has a clear eye for its beauty, and lastly, whilst he pitches his tent on this sacred volcanic isle of nature, does not offer to build houses and barns thereon,—',
'reverencing the splendor of the God which he sees bursting through each chink and cranny.',
'The world is filled with the proverbs and acts and winkings of a base prudence, which is a devotion to matter, as if we possessed no other faculties than the palate, the nose, the touch, the eye and ear;',
'a prudence which adores the Rule of Three, which never subscribes, which never gives, which seldom lends, and asks but one question of any project,—Will it bake bread?',
'This is a disease like a thickening of the skin until the vital organs are destroyed.',
'But culture, revealing the high origin of the apparent world and aiming at the perfection of the man as the end, degrades every thing else, as health and bodily life, into means.',
'It sees prudence not to be a several faculty, but a name for wisdom and virtue conversing with the body and its wants.',
'Cultivated men always feel and speak so, as if a great fortune, the achievement of a civil or social measure, great personal influence, a graceful and commanding address, had their value as proofs of the energy of the spirit.',
'If a man lose his balance and immerse himself in any trades or pleasures for their own sake, he may be a good wheel or pin, but he is not a cultivated man.',
'The spurious prudence, making the senses final, is the god of sots and cowards, and is the subject of all comedy.',
'It is nature’s joke, and therefore literature’s.',
'The true prudence limits this sensualism by admitting the knowledge of an internal and real world.',
'This recognition once made, the order of the world and the distribution of affairs and times, being studied with the co-perception of their subordinate place, will reward any degree of attention.',
'For our existence, thus apparently attached in nature to the sun and the returning moon and the periods which they mark,—so susceptible to climate and to country,',
'so alive to social good and evil,',
'so fond of splendor and so tender to hunger and cold and debt,—reads all its primary lessons out of these books.',
'Prudence does not go behind nature and ask whence it is.',
'It takes the laws of the world whereby man’s being is conditioned, as they are, and keeps these laws that it may enjoy their proper good.',
'It respects space and time, climate, want, sleep, the law of polarity, growth and death.',
'There revolve, to give bound and period to his being on all sides, the sun and moon, the great formalists in the sky: here lies stubborn matter, and will not swerve from its chemical routine.',
'Here is a planted globe, pierced and belted with natural laws and fenced and distributed externally with civil partitions and properties which impose new restraints on the young inhabitant.',
'We eat of the bread which grows in the field.',
'We live by the air which blows around us and we are poisoned by the air that is too cold or too hot, too dry or too wet.',
'Time, which shows so vacant, indivisible and divine in its coming, is slit and peddled into trifles and tatters.',
'A door is to be painted, a lock to be repaired.',
'I want wood or oil, or meal or salt; the house smokes, or I have a headache; then the tax, and an affair to be transacted with a man without heart or brains, and the stinging recollection of an injurious or very awkward word,—these eat up the hours.',
'Do what we can, summer will have its flies; if we walk in the woods we must feed mosquitos; if we go a-fishing we must expect a wet coat.',
'Then climate is a great impediment to idle persons; we often resolve to give up the care of the weather, but still we regard the clouds and the rain.',
'We are instructed by these petty experiences which usurp the hours and years.',
'The hard soil and four months of snow make the inhabitant of the northern temperate zone wiser and abler than his fellow who enjoys the fixed smile of the tropics.',
'The islander may ramble all day at will.',
'At night he may sleep on a mat under the moon, and wherever a wild date-tree grows, nature has, without a prayer even, spread a table for his morning meal.',
'The northerner is perforce a householder.',
'He must brew, bake, salt and preserve his food, and pile wood and coal.',
'But as it happens that not one stroke can labor lay to without some new acquaintance with nature, and as nature is inexhaustibly significant, the inhabitants of these climates have always excelled the southerner in force.',
'Such is the value of these matters that a man who knows other things can never know too much of these.',
'Let him have accurate perceptions.',
'Let him, if he have hands, handle; if eyes, measure and discriminate; let him accept and hive every fact of chemistry, natural history and economics; the more he has, the less is he willing to spare any one.',
'Time is always bringing the occasions that disclose their value.',
'Some wisdom comes out of every natural and innocent action.',
'The domestic man, who loves no music so well as his kitchen clock and the airs which the logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth, has solaces which others never dream of.',
'The application of means to ends insures victory and the songs of victory not less in a farm or a shop than in the tactics of party or of war.',
'The good husband finds method as efficient in the packing of fire-wood in a shed or in the harvesting of fruits in the cellar, as in Peninsular campaigns or the files of the Department of State.',
'In the rainy day he builds a work-bench, or gets his tool-box set in the corner of the barn-chamber, and stored with nails, gimlet, pincers, screwdriver and chisel.',
'Herein he tastes an old joy of youth and childhood, the cat-like love of garrets, presses and corn-chambers, and of the conveniences of long housekeeping.',
'His garden or his poultry-yard tells him many pleasant anecdotes.',
'One might find argument for optimism in the abundant flow of this saccharine element of pleasure in every suburb and extremity of the good world.',
'Let a man keep the law,—any law,—and his way will be strown with satisfactions.',
'There is more difference in the quality of our pleasures than in the amount.',
'On the other hand, nature punishes any neglect of prudence.',
'If you think the senses final, obey their law.',
'If you believe in the soul, do not clutch at sensual sweetness before it is ripe on the slow tree of cause and effect.',
'It is vinegar to the eyes to deal with men of loose and imperfect perception.',
'Dr. Johnson is reported to have said,—“If the child says he looked out of this window, when he looked out of that,—whip him.”',
'Our American character is marked by a more than average delight in accurate perception, which is shown by the currency of the byword, “No mistake.”',
'But the discomfort of unpunctuality, of confusion of thought about facts, of inattention to the wants of to-morrow, is of no nation.',
'The beautiful laws of time and space, once dislocated by our inaptitude, are holes and dens.',
'If the hive be disturbed by rash and stupid hands, instead of honey it will yield us bees.',
'Our words and actions to be fair must be timely.',
'A gay and pleasant sound is the whetting of the scythe in the mornings of June, yet what is more lonesome and sad than the sound of a whetstone or mower’s rifle when it is too late in the season to make hay?',
'Scatter-brained and “afternoon” men spoil much more than their own affair in spoiling the temper of those who deal with them.',
'I have seen a criticism on some paintings, of which I am reminded when I see the shiftless and unhappy men who are not true to their senses.',
'The last Grand Duke of Weimar, a man of superior understanding, said,—',
'“I have sometimes remarked in the presence of great works of art, and just now especially in Dresden, how much a certain property contributes to the effect which gives life to the figures, and to the life an irresistible truth.',
'This property is the hitting, in all the figures we draw, the right centre of gravity.',
'I mean the placing the figures firm upon their feet, making the hands grasp, and fastening the eyes on the spot where they should look.',
'Even lifeless figures, as vessels and stools—let them be drawn ever so correctly—lose all effect so soon as they lack the resting upon their centre of gravity, and have a certain swimming and oscillating appearance.',
'The Raphael in the Dresden gallery (the only greatly affecting picture which I have seen) is the quietest and most passionless piece you can imagine; a couple of saints who worship the Virgin and Child.',
'Nevertheless, it awakens a deeper impression than the contortions of ten crucified martyrs.',
'For beside all the resistless beauty of form, it possesses in the highest degree the property of the perpendicularity of all the figures.”',
'This perpendicularity we demand of all the figures in this picture of life.',
'Let them stand on their feet, and not float and swing.',
'Let us know where to find them.',
'Let them discriminate between what they remember and what they dreamed, call a spade a spade, give us facts, and honor their own senses with trust.',
'But what man shall dare tax another with imprudence?',
'Who is prudent?',
'The men we call greatest are least in this kingdom.',
'There is a certain fatal dislocation in our relation to nature, distorting our modes of living and making every law our enemy, which seems at last to have aroused all the wit and virtue in the world to ponder the question of Reform.',
'We must call the highest prudence to counsel, and ask why health and beauty and genius should now be the exception rather than the rule of human nature?',
'We do not know the properties of plants and animals and the laws of nature, through our sympathy with the same; but this remains the dream of poets.',
'Poetry and prudence should be coincident.',
'Poets should be lawgivers; that is, the boldest lyric inspiration should not chide and insult, but should announce and lead the civil code and the day’s work.',
'But now the two things seem irreconcilably parted.',
'We have violated law upon law until we stand amidst ruins, and when by chance we espy a coincidence between reason and the phenomena, we are surprised.',
'Beauty should be the dowry of every man and woman, as invariably as sensation; but it is rare.',
'Health or sound organization should be universal.',
'Genius should be the child of genius and every child should be inspired; but now it is not to be predicted of any child, and nowhere is it pure.',
'We call partial half-lights, by courtesy, genius; talent which converts itself to money; talent which glitters to-day that it may dine and sleep well to-morrow; and society is officered by men of parts, as they are properly called, and not by divine men.',
'These use their gifts to refine luxury, not to abolish it.',
'Genius is always ascetic, and piety, and love.',
'Appetite shows to the finer souls as a disease, and they find beauty in rites and bounds that resist it.',
'We have found out fine names to cover our sensuality withal, but no gifts can raise intemperance.',
'The man of talent affects to call his transgressions of the laws of the senses trivial and to count them nothing considered with his devotion to his art.',
'His art never taught him lewdness, nor the love of wine, nor the wish to reap where he had not sowed.',
'His art is less for every deduction from his holiness, and less for every defect of common sense.',
'On him who scorned the world as he said, the scorned world wreaks its revenge.',
'He that despiseth small things will perish by little and little.',
'Goethe’s Tasso is very likely to be a pretty fair historical portrait, and that is true tragedy.',
'It does not seem to me so genuine grief when some tyrannous Richard the Third oppresses and slays a score of innocent persons, as when Antonio and Tasso, both apparently right, wrong each other.',
'One living after the maxims of this world and consistent and true to them, the other fired with all divine sentiments, yet grasping also at the pleasures of sense, without submitting to their law.',
'That is a grief we all feel, a knot we cannot untie.',
'Tasso’s is no infrequent case in modern biography.',
'A man of genius, of an ardent temperament, reckless of physical laws, self-indulgent, becomes presently unfortunate, querulous, a “discomfortable cousin,” a thorn to himself and to others.',
'The scholar shames us by his bifold life.',
'Whilst something higher than prudence is active, he is admirable; when common sense is wanted, he is an encumbrance.',
'Yesterday, Cæsar was not so great; to-day, the felon at the gallows’ foot is not more miserable.',
'Yesterday, radiant with the light of an ideal world in which he lives, the first of men; and now oppressed by wants and by sickness, for which he must thank himself.',
'He resembles the pitiful drivellers whom travellers describe as frequenting the bazaars of Constantinople, who skulk about all day, yellow, emaciated, ragged, sneaking;',
'and at evening, when the bazaars are open, slink to the opium-shop, swallow their morsel and become tranquil and glorified seers.',
'And who has not seen the tragedy of imprudent genius struggling for years with paltry pecuniary difficulties, at last sinking, chilled, exhausted and fruitless, like a giant slaughtered by pins?',
'Is it not better that a man should accept the first pains and mortifications of this sort, which nature is not slack in sending him, as hints that he must expect no other good than the just fruit of his own labor and self-denial?',
'Health, bread, climate, social position, have their importance, and he will give them their due.',
'Let him esteem Nature a perpetual counsellor, and her perfections the exact measure of our deviations.',
'Let him make the night night, and the day day.',
'Let him control the habit of expense.',
'Let him see that as much wisdom may be expended on a private economy as on an empire, and as much wisdom may be drawn from it.',
'The laws of the world are written out for him on every piece of money in his hand.',
'There is nothing he will not be the better for knowing, were it only the wisdom of Poor Richard, or the State-Street prudence of buying by the acre to sell by the foot;',
'or the thrift of the agriculturist, to stick a tree between whiles, because it will grow whilst he sleeps;',
'or the prudence which consists in husbanding little strokes of the tool, little portions of time, particles of stock and small gains.',
'The eye of prudence may never shut.',
'Iron, if kept at the ironmonger’s, will rust;',
'beer, if not brewed in the right state of the atmosphere, will sour;',
'timber of ships will rot at sea, or if laid up high and dry, will strain, warp and dry-rot;',
'money, if kept by us, yields no rent and is liable to loss;',
'if invested, is liable to depreciation of the particular kind of stock.',
'Strike, says the smith, the iron is white; keep the rake, says the haymaker, as nigh the scythe as you can, and the cart as nigh the rake.',
'Our Yankee trade is reputed to be very much on the extreme of this prudence.',
'It takes bank-notes, good, bad, clean, ragged, and saves itself by the speed with which it passes them off.',
'Iron cannot rust, nor beer sour, nor timber rot, nor calicoes go out of fashion, nor money stocks depreciate, in the few swift moments in which the Yankee suffers any one of them to remain in his possession.',
'In skating over thin ice our safety is in our speed.',
'Let him learn a prudence of a higher strain.',
'Let him learn that every thing in nature, even motes and feathers, go by law and not by luck, and that what he sows he reaps.',
'By diligence and self-command let him put the bread he eats at his own disposal, that he may not stand in bitter and false relations to other men; for the best good of wealth is freedom.',
'Let him practise the minor virtues.',
'How much of human life is lost in waiting! let him not make his fellow-creatures wait.',
'How many words and promises are promises of conversation!',
'Let his be words of fate.',
'When he sees a folded and sealed scrap of paper float round the globe in a pine ship and come safe to the eye for which it was written, amidst a swarming population, let him likewise feel the admonition to integrate his being across all these distracting forces,',
'and keep a slender human word among the storms, distances and accidents that drive us hither and thither,',

'that is, the good man will be the wise man, and the single-hearted the politic man.',
'Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar, but is a stab at the health of human society.',
'On the most profitable lie the course of events presently lays a destructive tax; whilst frankness invites frankness, puts the parties on a convenient footing and makes their business a friendship.',
'Trust men and they will be true to you; treat them greatly and they will show themselves great, though they make an exception in your favor to all their rules of trade.',
'So, in regard to disagreeable and formidable things, prudence does not consist in evasion or in flight, but in courage.',
'He who wishes to walk in the most peaceful parts of life with any serenity must screw himself up to resolution.',

'VIII: HEROISM',
'“Paradise is under the shadow of swords.”',
'Mahomet.',
'Ruby wine is drunk by knaves,',
'Sugar spends to fatten slaves,',
'Rose and vine-leaf deck buffoons;',
'Thunderclouds are Jove’s festoons,',
'Drooping oft in wreaths of dread',
'Lightning-knotted round his head;',
'The hero is not fed on sweets,',
'Daily his own heart he eats;',
'Chambers of the great are jails,',
'And head-winds right for royal sails.',
'In the elder English dramatists, and mainly in the plays Of Beaumont and Fletcher, there is a constant recognition of gentility, as if a noble behavior were as easily marked in the society of their age as color is in our American population.',
'When any Rodrigo, Pedro or Valerio enters, though he be a stranger, the duke or governor exclaims, ‘This is a gentleman,—and proffers civilities without end; but all the rest are slag and refuse.',
'In harmony with this delight in personal advantages there is in their plays a certain heroic cast of character and dialogue,—',
'as in Bonduca, Sophocles, the Mad Lover, the Double Marriage,—',
'wherein the speaker is so earnest and cordial and on such deep grounds of character, that the dialogue, on the slightest additional incident in the plot, rises naturally into poetry.',
'Among many texts take the following.',
'The Roman Martius has conquered Athens,—all but the invincible spirits of Sophocles, the duke of Athens, and Dorigen, his wife.',
'The beauty of the latter inflames Martius, and he seeks to save her husband; but Sophocles will not ask his life, although assured that a word will save him, and the execution of both proceeds:—',
'Valerius.',
'Bid thy wife farewell.',
'Sophocles.',
'No, I will take no leave.',
'My Dorigen,',
'Yonder, above, ’bout Ariadne’s crown,',
'My spirit shall hover for thee.',
'Prithee, haste.',
'Dorigen.',
'Stay, Sophocles,—with this tie up my sight;',
'Let not soft nature so transformed be,',
'And lose her gentler sexed humanity,',
'To make me see my lord bleed.',
'So, ’tis well;',
'Never one object underneath the sun',
'Will I behold before my Sophocles:',
'Farewell; now teach the Romans how to die.',
'Martius.',
'Dost know what ’t is to die?',
'Sophocles.',
'Thou dost not, Martius,',
'And, therefore, not what ’tis to live; to die',
'Is to begin to live.',
'It is to end',
'An old, stale, weary work, and to commence',
'A newer and a better.',
'’Tis to leave',
'Deceitful knaves for the society',
'Of gods and goodness.',
'Thou thyself must part',
'At last from all thy garlands, pleasures, triumphs,',
'And prove thy fortitude what then ’t will do.',
'Valerius.',
'But art not grieved nor vexed to leave thy life thus?',
'Sophocles.',
'Why should I grieve or vex for being sent',
'To them I ever loved best?',
'Now I’ll kneel,',
'But with my back toward thee; ’tis the last duty',
'This trunk can do the gods.',
'Martius.',
'Strike, strike, Valerius,',
'Or Martius’ heart will leap out at his mouth.',
'This is a man, a woman.',
'Kiss thy lord,',
'And live with all the freedom you were wont.',
'O love! thou doubly hast afflicted me',
'With virtue and with beauty.',
'Treacherous heart,',
'My hand shall cast thee quick into my urn,',
'Ere thou transgress this knot of piety.',
'Valerius.',
'What ails my brother?',
'Sophocles.',
'Martius, O Martius,',
'Thou now hast found a way to conquer me.',
'Dorigen.',
'O star of Rome! what gratitude can speak',
'Fit words to follow such a deed as this?',
'Martius.',
'This admirable duke, Valerius,',
'With his disdain of fortune and of death,',
'Captived himself, has captivated me,',
'And though my arm hath ta’en his body here,',
'His soul hath subjugated Martius’ soul.',
'By Romulus, he is all soul, I think;',
'He hath no flesh, and spirit cannot be gyved;',
'Then we have vanquished nothing; he is free,',
'And Martius walks now in captivity.',
'I do not readily remember any poem, play, sermon, novel, or oration that our press vents in the last few years, which goes to the same tune.',
'We have a great many flutes and flageolets, but not often the sound of any fife.',
'Yet, Wordsworth’s “Laodamia,” and the ode of “Dion,” and some sonnets, have a certain noble music; and Scott will sometimes draw a stroke like the portrait of Lord Evandale given by Balfour of Burley.',
'Thomas Carlyle, with his natural taste for what is manly and daring in character, has suffered no heroic trait in his favorites to drop from his biographical and historical pictures.',
'Earlier, Robert Burns has given us a song or two.',
'In the Harleian Miscellanies there is an account of the battle of Lutzen which deserves to be read.',
'And Simon Ockley’s History of the Saracens recounts the prodigies of individual valor, with admiration all the more evident on the part of the narrator that he seems to think that his place in Christian Oxford requires of him some proper protestations of abhorrence.',
'But if we explore the literature of Heroism we shall quickly come to Plutarch, who is its Doctor and historian.',
'To him we owe the Brasidas, the Dion, the Epaminondas, the Scipio of old, and I must think we are more deeply indebted to him than to all the ancient writers.',
'Each of his “Lives” is a refutation to the despondency and cowardice of our religious and political theorists.',
'A wild courage, a Stoicism not of the schools but of the blood, shines in every anecdote, and has given that book its immense fame.',
'We need books of this tart cathartic virtue more than books of political science or of private economy.',
'Life is a festival only to the wise.',
'Seen from the nook and chimney-side of prudence, it wears a ragged and dangerous front.',
'The violations of the laws of nature by our predecessors and our contemporaries are punished in us also.',
'The disease and deformity around us certify the infraction of natural, intellectual, and moral laws, and often violation on violation to breed such compound misery.',
'A lock-jaw that bends a man’s head back to his heels;',
'hydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and babes;',
'insanity that makes him eat grass;',
'war, plague, cholera, famine, indicate a certain ferocity in nature, which, as it had its inlet by human crime, must have its outlet by human suffering.',
'Unhappily no man exists who has not in his own person become to some amount a stockholder in the sin, and so made himself liable to a share in the expiation.',
'Our culture therefore must not omit the arming of the man.',
'Let him hear in season that he is born into the state of war, and that the commonwealth and his own well-being require that he should not go dancing in the weeds of peace,',
'but warned, self-collected and neither defying nor dreading the thunder, let him take both reputation and life in his hand, and, with perfect urbanity dare the gibbet and the mob by the absolute truth of his speech and the rectitude of his behavior.',
'Towards all this external evil the man within the breast assumes a warlike attitude, and affirms his ability to cope single-handed with the infinite army of enemies.',
'To this military attitude of the soul we give the name of Heroism.',
'Its rudest form is the contempt for safety and ease, which makes the attractiveness of war.',
'It is a self-trust which slights the restraints of prudence, in the plenitude of its energy and power to repair the harms it may suffer.',
'The hero is a mind of such balance that no disturbances can shake his will, but pleasantly and as it were merrily he advances to his own music, alike in frightful alarms and in the tipsy mirth of universal dissoluteness.',
'There is somewhat not philosophical in heroism; there is somewhat not holy in it; it seems not to know that other souls are of one texture with it; it has pride; it is the extreme of individual nature.',
'Nevertheless we must profoundly revere it.',
'There is somewhat in great actions which does not allow us to go behind them.',
'Heroism feels and never reasons, and therefore is always right;',
'and although a different breeding, different religion and greater intellectual activity would have modified or even reversed the particular action, yet for the hero that thing he does is the highest deed, and is not open to the censure of philosophers or divines.',
'It is the avowal of the unschooled man that he finds a quality in him that is negligent of expense, of health, of life, of danger, of hatred, of reproach, and knows that his will is higher and more excellent than all actual and all possible antagonists.',
'Heroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind and in contradiction, for a time, to the voice of the great and good.',
'Heroism is an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual’s character.',
'Now to no other man can its wisdom appear as it does to him, for every man must be supposed to see a little farther on his own proper path than any one else.',
'Therefore just and wise men take umbrage at his act, until after some little time be past: then they see it to be in unison with their acts.',
'All prudent men see that the action is clean contrary to a sensual prosperity; for every heroic act measures itself by its contempt of some external good.',
'But it finds its own success at last, and then the prudent also extol.',
'Self-trust is the essence of heroism.',
'It is the state of the soul at war, and its ultimate objects are the last defiance of falsehood and wrong, and the power to bear all that can be inflicted by evil agents.',
'It speaks the truth and it is just, generous, hospitable, temperate, scornful of petty calculations and scornful of being scorned.',
'It persists; it is of an undaunted boldness and of a fortitude not to be wearied out.',
'Its jest is the littleness of common life.',
'That false prudence which dotes on health and wealth is the butt and merriment of heroism.',
'Heroism, like Plotinus, is almost ashamed of its body.',
'What shall it say then to the sugar-plums and cats’-cradles, to the toilet, compliments, quarrels, cards and custard, which rack the wit of all society?',
'What joys has kind nature provided for us dear creatures!',
'There seems to be no interval between greatness and meanness.',
'When the spirit is not master of the world, then it is its dupe.',
'Yet the little man takes the great hoax so innocently, works in it so headlong and believing,',
'is born red, and dies gray, arranging his toilet, attending on his own health, laying traps for sweet food and strong wine, setting his heart on a horse or a rifle, made happy with a little gossip or a little praise,',
'that the great soul cannot choose but laugh at such earnest nonsense.',
'“Indeed, these humble considerations make me out of love with greatness.',
'What a disgrace is it to me to take note how many pairs of silk stockings thou hast, namely, these and those that were the peach-colored ones; or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as one for superfluity, and one other for use!”',
'Citizens, thinking after the laws of arithmetic, consider the inconvenience of receiving strangers at their fireside, reckon narrowly the loss of time and the unusual display;',
'the soul of a better quality thrusts back the unseasonable economy into the vaults of life, and says, I will obey the God, and the sacrifice and the fire he will provide.',
'Ibn Hankal, the Arabian geographer, describes a heroic extreme in the hospitality of Sogd, in Bukharia.',
'“When I was in Sogd I saw a great building, like a palace, the gates of which were open and fixed back to the wall with large nails.',
'I asked the reason, and was told that the house had not been shut, night or day, for a hundred years.',
'Strangers may present themselves at any hour and in whatever number; the master has amply provided for the reception of the men and their animals, and is never happier than when they tarry for some time.',
'Nothing of the kind have I seen in any other country.”',
'The magnanimous know very well that they who give time, or money, or shelter, to the stranger,—so it be done for love and not for ostentation,—do, as it were, put God under obligation to them, so perfect are the compensations of the universe.',
'In some way the time they seem to lose is redeemed and the pains they seem to take remunerate themselves.',
'These men fan the flame of human love and raise the standard of civil virtue among mankind.',
'But hospitality must be for service and not for show, or it pulls down the host.',
'The brave soul rates itself too high to value itself by the splendor of its table and draperies.',
'It gives what it hath, and all it hath, but its own majesty can lend a better grace to bannocks and fair water than belong to city feasts.',
'The temperance of the hero proceeds from the same wish to do no dishonor to the worthiness he has.',
'But he loves it for its elegancy, not for its austerity.',
'It seems not worth his while to be solemn and denounce with bitterness flesh-eating or wine-drinking, the use of tobacco, or opium, or tea, or silk, or gold.',
'A great man scarcely knows how he dines, how he dresses; but without railing or precision his living is natural and poetic.',
'John Eliot, the Indian Apostle, drank water, and said of wine,—“It is a noble, generous liquor and we should be humbly thankful for it, but, as I remember, water was made before it.”',
'Better still is the temperance of King David, who poured out on the ground unto the Lord the water which three of his warriors had brought him to drink, at the peril of their lives.',
'It is told of Brutus, that when he fell on his sword after the battle of Philippi, he quoted a line of Euripides,—“O Virtue!',
'I have followed thee through life, and I find thee at last but a shade.”',
'I doubt not the hero is slandered by this report.',
'The heroic soul does not sell its justice and its nobleness.',
'It does not ask to dine nicely and to sleep warm.',
'The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough.',
'Poverty is its ornament.',
'It does not need plenty, and can very well abide its loss.',
'But that which takes my fancy most in the heroic class, is the good-humor and hilarity they exhibit.',
'It is a height to which common duty can very well attain, to suffer and to dare with solemnity.',
'But these rare souls set opinion, success, and life at so cheap a rate that they will not soothe their enemies by petitions, or the show of sorrow, but wear their own habitual greatness.',
'Scipio, charged with peculation, refuses to do himself so great a disgrace as to wait for justification, though he had the scroll of his accounts in his hands, but tears it to pieces before the tribunes.',
'Socrates’s condemnation of himself to be maintained in all honor in the Prytaneum, during his life, and Sir Thomas More’s playfulness at the scaffold, are of the same strain.',
'In Beaumont and Fletcher’s “Sea Voyage,” Juletta tells the stout captain and his company,—',
'Juletta.',
'Why, slaves, ’tis in our power to hang ye.',
'Master.',
'Very likely,',
'’Tis in our powers, then, to be hanged, and scorn ye.',
'These replies are sound and whole.',
'Sport is the bloom and glow of a perfect health.',
'The great will not condescend to take any thing seriously; all must be as gay as the song of a canary, though it were the building of cities or the eradication of old and foolish churches and nations which have cumbered the earth long thousands of years.',
'Simple hearts put all the history and customs of this world behind them, and play their own game in innocent defiance of the Blue-Laws of the world;',
'and such would appear, could we see the human race assembled in vision, like little children frolicking together, though to the eyes of mankind at large they wear a stately and solemn garb of works and influences.',
'The interest these fine stories have for us, the power of a romance over the boy who grasps the forbidden book under his bench at school, our delight in the hero, is the main fact to our purpose.',
'All these great and transcendent properties are ours.',
'If we dilate in beholding the Greek energy, the Roman pride, it is that we are already domesticating the same sentiment.',
'Let us find room for this great guest in our small houses.',
'The first step of worthiness will be to disabuse us of our superstitious associations with places and times, with number and size.',
'Why should these words, Athenian, Roman, Asia and England, so tingle in the ear?',
'Where the heart is, there the muses, there the gods sojourn, and not in any geography of fame.',
'Massachusetts, Connecticut River and Boston Bay you think paltry places, and the ear loves names of foreign and classic topography.',
'But here we are; and, if we will tarry a little, we may come to learn that here is best.',
'See to it only that thyself is here, and art and nature, hope and fate, friends, angels and the Supreme Being shall not be absent from the chamber where thou sittest.',

'He lies very well where he is.',
'The Jerseys were handsome ground enough for Washington to tread, and London streets for the feet of Milton.',
'A great man makes his climate genial in the imagination of men, and its air the beloved element of all delicate spirits.',
'That country is the fairest which is inhabited by the noblest minds.',
'The pictures which fill the imagination in reading the actions of Pericles, Xenophon, Columbus, Bayard, Sidney, Hampden, teach us how needlessly mean our life is;',
'that we, by the depth of our living, should deck it with more than regal or national splendor, and act on principles that should interest man and nature in the length of our days.',
'We have seen or heard of many extraordinary young men who never ripened, or whose performance in actual life was not extraordinary.',
'When we see their air and mien, when we hear them speak of society, of books, of religion, we admire their superiority; they seem to throw contempt on our entire polity and social state; theirs is the tone of a youthful giant who is sent to work revolutions.',
'But they enter an active profession and the forming Colossus shrinks to the common size of man.',
'The magic they used was the ideal tendencies, which always make the Actual ridiculous; but the tough world had its revenge the moment they put their horses of the sun to plough in its furrow.',
'They found no example and no companion, and their heart fainted.',
'What then?',
'The lesson they gave in their first aspirations is yet true; and a better valor and a purer truth shall one day organize their belief.',
'Or why should a woman liken herself to any historical woman, and think, because Sappho, or Sévigné, or De Staël, or the cloistered souls who have had genius and cultivation do not satisfy the imagination and the serene Themis, none can,—certainly not she?',
'Why not?',
'She has a new and unattempted problem to solve, perchance that of the happiest nature that ever bloomed.',
'Let the maiden, with erect soul, walk serenely on her way, accept the hint of each new experience, search in turn all the objects that solicit her eye, that she may learn the power and the charm of her new-born being, which is the kindling of a new dawn in the recesses of space.',
'The fair girl who repels interference by a decided and proud choice of influences, so careless of pleasing, so wilful and lofty, inspires every beholder with somewhat of her own nobleness.',
'The silent heart encourages her; O friend, never strike sail to a fear!',
'Come into port greatly, or sail with God the seas.',
'Not in vain you live, for every passing eye is cheered and refined by the vision.',
'The characteristic of heroism is its persistency.',
'All men have wandering impulses, fits and starts of generosity.',
'But when you have chosen your part, abide by it, and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself with the world.',
'The heroic cannot be the common, nor the common the heroic.',
'Yet we have the weakness to expect the sympathy of people in those actions whose excellence is that they outrun sympathy and appeal to a tardy justice.',
'If you would serve your brother, because it is fit for you to serve him, do not take back your words when you find that prudent people do not commend you.',
'Adhere to your own act, and congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant and broken the monotony of a decorous age.',
'It was a high counsel that I once heard given to a young person,—“Always do what you are afraid to do.”',
'A simple manly character need never make an apology, but should regard its past action with the calmness of Phocion, when he admitted that the event of the battle was happy, yet did not regret his dissuasion from the battle.',

'Let us be generous of our dignity as well as of our money.',
'Greatness once and for ever has done with opinion.',
'We tell our charities, not because we wish to be praised for them, not because we think they have great merit, but for our justification.',
'It is a capital blunder; as you discover when another man recites his charities.',
'To speak the truth, even with some austerity,',
'to live with some rigor of temperance, or some extremes of generosity, seems to be an asceticism which common good-nature would appoint to those who are at ease and in plenty, in sign that they feel a brotherhood with the great multitude of suffering men.',
'And not only need we breathe and exercise the soul by assuming the penalties of abstinence, of debt, of solitude, of unpopularity,—',
'but it behooves the wise man to look with a bold eye into those rarer dangers which sometimes invade men, and to familiarize himself with disgusting forms of disease, with sounds of execration, and the vision of violent death.',
'Times of heroism are generally times of terror, but the day never shines in which this element may not work.',
'The circumstances of man, we say, are historically somewhat better in this country and at this hour than perhaps ever before.',

'Who that sees the meanness of our politics but inly congratulates Washington that he is long already wrapped in his shroud, and for ever safe; that he was laid sweet in his grave, the hope of humanity not yet subjugated in him?',
'Who does not sometimes envy the good and brave who are no more to suffer from the tumults of the natural world, and await with curious complacency the speedy term of his own conversation with finite nature?',

'that I desire and look up and put myself in the attitude of reception, but from some alien energy the visions come.',
'The Supreme Critic on the errors of the past and the present, and the only prophet of that which must be, is that great nature in which we rest as the earth lies in the soft arms of the atmosphere;',
'that Unity, that Over-soul, within which every man’s particular being is contained and made one with all other;',
'that common heart of which all sincere conversation is the worship, to which all right action is submission;',
'that overpowering reality which confutes our tricks and talents, and constrains every one to pass for what he is, and to speak from his character and not from his tongue, and which evermore tends to pass into our thought and hand and become wisdom and virtue and power and beauty.',
'We live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles.',
'Meantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related; the eternal ONE.',
'And this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all accessible to us, is not only self-sufficing and perfect in every hour, but the act of seeing and the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle, the subject and the object, are one.',
'We see the world piece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the tree; but the whole, of which these are the shining parts, is the soul.',
'Only by the vision of that Wisdom can the horoscope of the ages be read, and by falling back on our better thoughts, by yielding to the spirit of prophecy which is innate in every man, we can know what it saith.',
'Every man’s words who speaks from that life must sound vain to those who do not dwell in the same thought on their own part.',
'I dare not speak for it.',
'My words do not carry its august sense; they fall short and cold.',
'Only itself can inspire whom it will, and behold! their speech shall be lyrical, and sweet, and universal as the rising of the wind.',
'Yet I desire, even by profane words, if I may not use sacred, to indicate the heaven of this deity and to report what hints I have collected of the transcendent simplicity and energy of the Highest Law.',
'If we consider what happens in conversation, in reveries, in remorse, in times of passion, in surprises, in the instructions of dreams, wherein often we see ourselves in masquerade,—',
'the droll disguises only magnifying and enhancing a real element and forcing it on our distinct notice,—',
'we shall catch many hints that will broaden and lighten into knowledge of the secret of nature.',
'All goes to show that the soul in man is not an organ, but animates and exercises all the organs;',
'is not a function, like the power of memory, of calculation, of comparison, but uses these as hands and feet;',
'is not a faculty, but a light;',
'is not the intellect or the will, but the master of the intellect and the will;',
'is the background of our being, in which they lie,—an immensity not possessed and that cannot be possessed.',
'From within or from behind, a light shines through us upon things and makes us aware that we are nothing, but the light is all.',
'A man is the facade of a temple wherein all wisdom and all good abide.',
'What we commonly call man, the eating, drinking, planting, counting man, does not, as we know him, represent himself, but misrepresents himself.',
'Him we do not respect, but the soul, whose organ he is, would he let it appear through his action, would make our knees bend.',
'When it breathes through his intellect, it is genius; when it breathes through his will, it is virtue; when it flows through his affection, it is love.',
'And the blindness of the intellect begins when it would be something of itself.',
'The weakness of the will begins when the individual would be something of himself.',
'All reform aims in some one particular to let the soul have its way through us; in other words, to engage us to obey.',
'Of this pure nature every man is at some time sensible.',
'Language cannot paint it with his colors.',
'It is too subtile.',
'It is undefinable, unmeasurable; but we know that it pervades and contains us.',
'We know that all spiritual being is in man.',
'A wise old proverb says, “God comes to see us without bell;” that is, as there is no screen or ceiling between our heads and the infinite heavens, so is there no bar or wall in the soul where man, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins.',
'The walls are taken away.',
'We lie open on one side to the deeps of spiritual nature, to the attributes of God.',
'Justice we see and know, Love, Freedom, Power.',
'These natures no man ever got above, but they tower over us, and most in the moment when our interests tempt us to wound them.',
'The sovereignty of this nature whereof we speak is made known by its independency of those limitations which circumscribe us on every hand.',
'The soul circumscribes all things.',
'As I have said, it contradicts all experience.',
'In like manner it abolishes time and space.',
'The influence of the senses has in most men overpowered the mind to that degree that the walls of time and space have come to look real and insurmountable; and to speak with levity of these limits is, in the world, the sign of insanity.',
'Yet time and space are but inverse measures of the force of the soul.',
'The spirit sports with time,—',
'“Can crowd eternity into an hour,',
'Or stretch an hour to eternity.”',
'We are often made to feel that there is another youth and age than that which is measured from the year of our natural birth.',
'Some thoughts always find us young, and keep us so.',
'Such a thought is the love of the universal and eternal beauty.',
'Every man parts from that contemplation with the feeling that it rather belongs to ages than to mortal life.',
'The least activity of the intellectual powers redeems us in a degree from the conditions of time.',
'In sickness, in languor, give us a strain of poetry or a profound sentence, and we are refreshed; or produce a volume of Plato or Shakspeare, or remind us of their names, and instantly we come into a feeling of longevity.',
'See how the deep divine thought reduces centuries and millenniums and makes itself present through all ages.',
'Is the teaching of Christ less effective now than it was when first his mouth was opened?',
'The emphasis of facts and persons in my thought has nothing to do with time.',
'And so always the soul’s scale is one, the scale of the senses and the understanding is another.',
'Before the revelations of the soul, Time, Space and Nature shrink away.',
'In common speech we refer all things to time, as we habitually refer the immensely sundered stars to one concave sphere.',
'And so we say that the Judgment is distant or near, that the Millennium approaches, that a day of certain political, moral,',
'social reforms is at hand, and the like, when we mean that in the nature of things one of the facts we contemplate is external and fugitive, and the other is permanent and connate with the soul.',
'The things we now esteem fixed shall, one by one, detach themselves like ripe fruit from our experience, and fall.',
'The wind shall blow them none knows whither.',
'The landscape, the figures, Boston, London, are facts as fugitive as any institution past, or any whiff of mist or smoke, and so is society, and so is the world.',
'The soul looketh steadily forwards, creating a world before her, leaving worlds behind her.',
'She has no dates, nor rites, nor persons, nor specialties nor men.',
'The soul knows only the soul; the web of events is the flowing robe in which she is clothed.',
'After its own law and not by arithmetic is the rate of its progress to be computed.',
'The soul’s advances are not made by gradation, such as can be represented by motion in a straight line, but rather by ascension of state, such as can be represented by metamorphosis,—from the egg to the worm, from the worm to the fly.',
'The growths of genius are of a certain total character, that does not advance the elect individual first over John, then Adam, then Richard, and give to each the pain of discovered inferiority,—',
'but by every throe of growth the man expands there where he works, passing, at each pulsation, classes, populations, of men.',
'With each divine impulse the mind rends the thin rinds of the visible and finite, and comes out into eternity, and inspires and expires its air.',
'It converses with truths that have always been spoken in the world, and becomes conscious of a closer sympathy with Zeno and Arrian than with persons in the house.',
'This is the law of moral and of mental gain.',
'The simple rise as by specific levity not into a particular virtue, but into the region of all the virtues.',
'They are in the spirit which contains them all.',
'The soul requires purity, but purity is not it; requires justice, but justice is not that; requires beneficence, but is somewhat better; so that there is a kind of descent and accommodation felt when we leave speaking of moral nature to urge a virtue which it enjoins.',
'To the well-born child all the virtues are natural, and not painfully acquired.',
'Speak to his heart, and the man becomes suddenly virtuous.',
'Within the same sentiment is the germ of intellectual growth, which obeys the same law.',
'Those who are capable of humility, of justice, of love, of aspiration, stand already on a platform that commands the sciences and arts, speech and poetry, action and grace.',
'For whoso dwells in this moral beatitude already anticipates those special powers which men prize so highly.',
'The lover has no talent, no skill, which passes for quite nothing with his enamoured maiden, however little she may possess of related faculty;',
'and the heart which abandons itself to the Supreme Mind finds itself related to all its works, and will travel a royal road to particular knowledges and powers.',
'In ascending to this primary and aboriginal sentiment we have come from our remote station on the circumference instantaneously to the centre of the world, where, as in the closet of God, we see causes, and anticipate the universe, which is but a slow effect.',
'One mode of the divine teaching is the incarnation of the spirit in a form,—in forms, like my own.',
'I live in society, with persons who answer to thoughts in my own mind, or express a certain obedience to the great instincts to which I live.',
'I see its presence to them.',
'I am certified of a common nature; and these other souls, these separated selves, draw me as nothing else can.',
'They stir in me the new emotions we call passion; of love, hatred, fear, admiration, pity; thence come conversation, competition, persuasion, cities and war.',
'Persons are supplementary to the primary teaching of the soul.',
'In youth we are mad for persons.',
'Childhood and youth see all the world in them.',
'But the larger experience of man discovers the identical nature appearing through them all.',
'Persons themselves acquaint us with the impersonal.',
'In all conversation between two persons tacit reference is made, as to a third party, to a common nature.',
'That third party or common nature is not social; it is impersonal; is God.',
'And so in groups where debate is earnest, and especially on high questions, the company become aware that the thought rises to an equal level in all bosoms, that all have a spiritual property in what was said, as well as the sayer.',
'They all become wiser than they were.',
'It arches over them like a temple, this unity of thought in which every heart beats with nobler sense of power and duty, and thinks and acts with unusual solemnity.',
'All are conscious of attaining to a higher self-possession.',
'It shines for all.',
'There is a certain wisdom of humanity which is common to the greatest men with the lowest, and which our ordinary education often labors to silence and obstruct.',
'The mind is one, and the best minds, who love truth for its own sake, think much less of property in truth.',
'They accept it thankfully everywhere, and do not label or stamp it with any man’s name, for it is theirs long beforehand, and from eternity.',
'The learned and the studious of thought have no monopoly of wisdom.',
'Their violence of direction in some degree disqualifies them to think truly.',
'We owe many valuable observations to people who are not very acute or profound, and who say the thing without effort which we want and have long been hunting in vain.',
'The action of the soul is oftener in that which is felt and left unsaid than in that which is said in any conversation.',
'It broods over every society, and they unconsciously seek for it in each other.',
'We know better than we do.',
'We do not yet possess ourselves, and we know at the same time that we are much more.',
'I feel the same truth how often in my trivial conversation with my neighbors, that somewhat higher in each of us overlooks this by-play, and Jove nods to Jove from behind each of us.',
'Men descend to meet.',
'In their habitual and mean service to the world, for which they forsake their native nobleness, they resemble those Arabian sheiks who dwell in mean houses and affect an external poverty,',
'to escape the rapacity of the Pacha, and reserve all their display of wealth for their interior and guarded retirements.',
'As it is present in all persons, so it is in every period of life.',
'It is adult already in the infant man.',
'In my dealing with my child, my Latin and Greek, my accomplishments and my money stead me nothing; but as much soul as I have avails.',
'If I am wilful, he sets his will against mine, one for one, and leaves me, if I please, the degradation of beating him by my superiority of strength.',
'But if I renounce my will and act for the soul, setting that up as umpire between us two, out of his young eyes looks the same soul; he reveres and loves with me.',
'The soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth.',
'We know truth when we see it, let skeptic and scoffer say what they choose.',
'Foolish people ask you, when you have spoken what they do not wish to hear, ‘How do you know it is truth, and not an error of your own?’',
'We know truth when we see it, from opinion, as we know when we are awake that we are awake.',
'It was a grand sentence of Emanuel Swedenborg, which would alone indicate the greatness of that man’s perception,—“It is no proof of a man’s understanding to be able to confirm whatever he pleases;',
'but to be able to discern that what is true is true, and that what is false is false,—this is the mark and character of intelligence.”',
'In the book I read, the good thought returns to me, as every truth will, the image of the whole soul.',
'To the bad thought which I find in it, the same soul becomes a discerning, separating sword, and lops it away.',
'We are wiser than we know.',
'If we will not interfere with our thought, but will act entirely, or see how the thing stands in God, we know the particular thing, and every thing, and every man.',
'For the Maker of all things and all persons stands behind us and casts his dread omniscience through us over things.',
'But beyond this recognition of its own in particular passages of the individual’s experience, it also reveals truth.',
'And here we should seek to reinforce ourselves by its very presence, and to speak with a worthier, loftier strain of that advent.',
'For the soul’s communication of truth is the highest event in nature, since it then does not give somewhat from itself, but it gives itself, or passes into and becomes that man whom it enlightens; or, in proportion to that truth he receives, it takes him to itself.',
'We distinguish the announcements of the soul, its manifestations of its own nature, by the term Revelation.',
'These are always attended by the emotion of the sublime.',
'For this communication is an influx of the Divine mind into our mind.',
'It is an ebb of the individual rivulet before the flowing surges of the sea of life.',
'Every distinct apprehension of this central commandment agitates men with awe and delight.',
'A thrill passes through all men at the reception of new truth, or at the performance of a great action, which comes out of the heart of nature.',
'In these communications the power to see is not separated from the will to do, but the insight proceeds from obedience, and the obedience proceeds from a joyful perception.',
'Every moment when the individual feels himself invaded by it is memorable.',
'By the necessity of our constitution a certain enthusiasm attends the individual’s consciousness of that divine presence.',
'The character and duration of this enthusiasm varies with the state of the individual, from an ecstasy and trance and prophetic inspiration,—',
'which is its rarer appearance,—',
'to the faintest glow of virtuous emotion, in which form it warms, like our household fires, all the families and associations of men, and makes society possible.',
'A certain tendency to insanity has always attended the opening of the religious sense in men, as if they had been “blasted with excess of light.”',
'The trances of Socrates, the “union” of Plotinus, the vision of Porphyry, the conversion of Paul, the aurora of Behmen, the convulsions of George Fox and his Quakers, the illumination of Swedenborg, are of this kind.',
'What was in the case of these remarkable persons a ravishment, has, in innumerable instances in common life, been exhibited in less striking manner.',
'Everywhere the history of religion betrays a tendency to enthusiasm.',
'The rapture of the Moravian and Quietist;',
'the opening of the internal sense of the Word, in the language of the New Jerusalem Church;',
'the revival of the Calvinistic churches;',
'the experiences of the Methodists, are varying forms of that shudder of awe and delight with which the individual soul always mingles with the universal soul.',
'The nature of these revelations is the same; they are perceptions of the absolute law.',
'They are solutions of the soul’s own questions.',
'They do not answer the questions which the understanding asks.',
'The soul answers never by words, but by the thing itself that is inquired after.',
'Revelation is the disclosure of the soul.',
'The popular notion of a revelation is that it is a telling of fortunes.',
'In past oracles of the soul the understanding seeks to find answers to sensual questions, and undertakes to tell from God how long men shall exist, what their hands shall do and who shall be their company, adding names and dates and places.',
'But we must pick no locks.',
'We must check this low curiosity.',
'An answer in words is delusive; it is really no answer to the questions you ask.',
'Do not require a description of the countries towards which you sail.',
'The description does not describe them to you, and to-morrow you arrive there and know them by inhabiting them.',
'Men ask concerning the immortality of the soul, the employments of heaven, the state of the sinner, and so forth.',
'They even dream that Jesus has left replies to precisely these interrogatories.',
'Never a moment did that sublime spirit speak in their patois.',
'To truth, justice, love, the attributes of the soul, the idea of immutableness is essentially associated.',
'Jesus, living in these moral sentiments, heedless of sensual fortunes, heeding only the manifestations of these, never made the separation of the idea of duration from the essence of these attributes, nor uttered a syllable concerning the duration of the soul.',
'It was left to his disciples to sever duration from the moral elements, and to teach the immortality of the soul as a doctrine, and maintain it by evidences.',
'The moment the doctrine of the immortality is separately taught, man is already fallen.',
'In the flowing of love, in the adoration of humility, there is no question of continuance.',
'No inspired man ever asks this question or condescends to these evidences.',
'For the soul is true to itself, and the man in whom it is shed abroad cannot wander from the present, which is infinite, to a future which would be finite.',
'These questions which we lust to ask about the future are a confession of sin.',
'God has no answer for them.',
'No answer in words can reply to a question of things.',
'It is not in an arbitrary “decree of God,” but in the nature of man, that a veil shuts down on the facts of to-morrow; for the soul will not have us read any other cipher than that of cause and effect.',
'By this veil which curtains events it instructs the children of men to live in to-day.',
'The only mode of obtaining an answer to these questions of the senses is to forego all low curiosity,',
'and, accepting the tide of being which floats us into the secret of nature, work and live, work and live,',
'and all unawares the advancing soul has built and forged for itself a new condition,',
'and the question and the answer are one.',
'By the same fire, vital, consecrating, celestial, which burns until it shall dissolve all things into the waves and surges of an ocean of light, we see and know each other, and what spirit each is of.',
'Who can tell the grounds of his knowledge of the character of the several individuals in his circle of friends?',
'No man.',
'Yet their acts and words do not disappoint him.',
'In that man, though he knew no ill of him, he put no trust.',
'In that other, though they had seldom met, authentic signs had yet passed, to signify that he might be trusted as one who had an interest in his own character.',
'We know each other very well,—which of us has been just to himself and whether that which we teach or behold is only an aspiration or is our honest effort also.',
'We are all discerners of spirits.',
'That diagnosis lies aloft in our life or unconscious power.',
'The intercourse of society, its trade, its religion, its friendships, its quarrels, is one wide, judicial investigation of character.',
'In full court, or in small committee, or confronted face to face, accuser and accused, men offer themselves to be judged.',
'Against their will they exhibit those decisive trifles by which character is read.',
'But who judges? and what?',
'Not our understanding.',
'We do not read them by learning or craft.',
'No; the wisdom of the wise man consists herein, that he does not judge them; he lets them judge themselves and merely reads and records their own verdict.',
'By virtue of this inevitable nature, private will is overpowered, and, maugre our efforts or our imperfections, your genius will speak from you, and mine from me.',
'That which we are, we shall teach, not voluntarily but involuntarily.',
'Thoughts come into our minds by avenues which we never left open, and thoughts go out of our minds through avenues which we never voluntarily opened.',
'Character teaches over our head.',
'The infallible index of true progress is found in the tone the man takes.',
'Neither his age, nor his breeding, nor company, nor books, nor actions, nor talents, nor all together can hinder him from being deferential to a higher spirit than his own.',
'If he have not found his home in God, his manners, his forms of speech, the turn of his sentences, the build, shall I say, of all his opinions will involuntarily confess it, let him brave it out how he will.',
'If he have found his centre, the Deity will shine through him, through all the disguises of ignorance, of ungenial temperament, of unfavorable circumstance.',
'The tone of seeking is one, and the tone of having is another.',
'The great distinction between teachers sacred or literary,—',
'between poets like Herbert, and poets like Pope,—',
'between philosophers like Spinoza, Kant and Coleridge, and philosophers like Locke, Paley, Mackintosh and Stewart,—',
'between men of the world who are reckoned accomplished talkers, and here and there a fervent mystic, prophesying half insane under the infinitude of his thought,—',
'is that one class speak from within, or from experience, as parties and possessors of the fact;',
'and the other class from without, as spectators merely, or perhaps as acquainted with the fact on the evidence of third persons.',
'It is of no use to preach to me from without.',
'I can do that too easily myself.',
'Jesus speaks always from within, and in a degree that transcends all others.',
'In that is the miracle.',
'I believe beforehand that it ought so to be.',
'All men stand continually in the expectation of the appearance of such a teacher.',
'But if a man do not speak from within the veil, where the word is one with that it tells of, let him lowly confess it.',
'The same Omniscience flows into the intellect, and makes what we call genius.',
'Much of the wisdom of the world is not wisdom, and the most illuminated class of men are no doubt superior to literary fame, and are not writers.',
'Among the multitude of scholars and authors, we feel no hallowing presence;',
'we are sensible of a knack and skill rather than of inspiration;',
'they have a light and know not whence it comes and call it their own;',
'their talent is some exaggerated faculty, some overgrown member, so that their strength is a disease.',
'In these instances the intellectual gifts do not make the impression of virtue, but almost of vice; and we feel that a man’s talents stand in the way of his advancement in truth.',
'But genius is religious.',
'It is a larger imbibing of the common heart.',
'It is not anomalous, but more like and not less like other men.',
'There is in all great poets a wisdom of humanity which is superior to any talents they exercise.',
'The author, the wit, the partisan, the fine gentleman, does not take place of the man.',
'Humanity shines in Homer, in Chaucer, in Spenser, in Shakspeare, in Milton.',
'They are content with truth.',
'They use the positive degree.',
'They seem frigid and phlegmatic to those who have been spiced with the frantic passion and violent coloring of inferior but popular writers.',
'For they are poets by the free course which they allow to the informing soul, which through their eyes beholds again and blesses the things which it hath made.',
'The soul is superior to its knowledge, wiser than any of its works.',
'The great poet makes us feel our own wealth, and then we think less of his compositions.',
'His best communication to our mind is to teach us to despise all he has done.',
'Shakspeare carries us to such a lofty strain of intelligent activity as to suggest a wealth which beggars his own;',
'and we then feel that the splendid works which he has created, and which in other hours we extol as a sort of self-existent poetry, take no stronger hold of real nature than the shadow of a passing traveller on the rock.',
'The inspiration which uttered itself in Hamlet and Lear could utter things as good from day to day for ever.',
'Why then should I make account of Hamlet and Lear, as if we had not the soul from which they fell as syllables from the tongue?',
'This energy does not descend into individual life on any other condition than entire possession.',
'It comes to the lowly and simple; it comes to whomsoever will put off what is foreign and proud; it comes as insight; it comes as serenity and grandeur.',
'When we see those whom it inhabits, we are apprised of new degrees of greatness.',
'From that inspiration the man comes back with a changed tone.',
'He does not talk with men with an eye to their opinion.',
'He tries them.',
'It requires of us to be plain and true.',
'The vain traveller attempts to embellish his life by quoting my lord and the prince and the countess, who thus said or did to him.',
'The ambitious vulgar show you their spoons and brooches and rings, and preserve their cards and compliments.',
'The more cultivated, in their account of their own experience, cull out the pleasing, poetic circumstance,—the visit to Rome, the man of genius they saw, the brilliant friend They know;',
'still further on perhaps the gorgeous landscape, the mountain lights, the mountain thoughts they enjoyed yesterday,—and so seek to throw a romantic color over their life.',
'But the soul that ascends to worship the great God is plain and true;',
'has no rose-color, no fine friends, no chivalry, no adventures;',
'does not want admiration;',
'dwells in the hour that now is, in the earnest experience of the common day,—by reason of the present moment and the mere trifle having become porous to thought and bibulous of the sea of light.',
'Converse with a mind that is grandly simple, and literature looks like word-catching.',
'The simplest utterances are worthiest to be written,',
'yet are they so cheap and so things of course, that in the infinite riches of the soul it is like gathering a few pebbles off the ground, or bottling a little air in a phial, when the whole earth and the whole atmosphere are ours.',
'Nothing can pass there, or make you one of the circle, but the casting aside your trappings, and dealing man to man in naked truth, plain confession, and omniscient affirmation.',
'Souls such as these treat you as gods would, walk as gods in the earth, accepting without any admiration your wit, your bounty, your virtue even,—',
'say rather your act of duty, for your virtue they own as their proper blood, royal as themselves, and over-royal, and the father of the gods.',
'But what rebuke their plain fraternal bearing casts on the mutual flattery with which authors solace each other and wound themselves!',
'These flatter not.',
'I do not wonder that these men go to see Cromwell and Christina and Charles the Second and James the First and the Grand Turk.',
'For they are, in their own elevation, the fellows of kings, and must feel the servile tone of conversation in the world.',
'They must always be a godsend to princes, for they confront them, a king to a king, without ducking or concession, and give a high nature the refreshment and satisfaction of resistance, of plain humanity, of even companionship and of new ideas.',
'They leave them wiser and superior men.',
'Souls like these make us feel that sincerity is more excellent than flattery.',
'Deal so plainly with man and woman as to constrain the utmost sincerity and destroy all hope of trifling with you.',
'It is the highest compliment you can pay.',
'Their “highest praising,” said Milton, “is not flattery, and their plainest advice is a kind of praising.”',
'Ineffable is the union of man and God in every act of the soul.',
'The simplest person who in his integrity worships God, becomes God; yet for ever and ever the influx of this better and universal self is new and unsearchable.',
'It inspires awe and astonishment.',
'How dear, how soothing to man, arises the idea of God, peopling the lonely place, effacing the scars of our mistakes and disappointments!',
'When we have broken our god of tradition and ceased from our god of rhetoric, then may God fire the heart with his presence.',
'It is the doubling of the heart itself, nay, the infinite enlargement of the heart with a power of growth to a new infinity on every side.',
'It inspires in man an infallible trust.',
'He has not the conviction, but the sight, that the best is the true, and may in that thought easily dismiss all particular uncertainties and fears, and adjourn to the sure revelation of time the solution of his private riddles.',
'He is sure that his welfare is dear to the heart of being.',
'In the presence of law to his mind he is overflowed with a reliance so universal that it sweeps away all cherished hopes and the most stable projects of mortal condition in its flood.',
'He believes that he cannot escape from his good.',
'The things that are really for thee gravitate to thee.',
'You are running to seek your friend.',
'Let your feet run, but your mind need not.',
'If you do not find him, will you not acquiesce that it is best you should not find him? for there is a power, which, as it is in you, is in him also, and could therefore very well bring you together, if it were for the best.',
'You are preparing with eagerness to go and render a service to which your talent and your taste invite you, the love of men and the hope of fame.',
'Has it not occurred to you that you have no right to go, unless you are equally willing to be prevented from going?',
'O, believe, as thou livest, that every sound that is spoken over the round world, which thou oughtest to hear, will vibrate on thine ear!',
'Every proverb, every book, every byword that belongs to thee for aid or comfort, shall surely come home through open or winding passages.',
'Every friend whom not thy fantastic will but the great and tender heart in thee craveth, shall lock thee in his embrace.',
'And this because the heart in thee is the heart of all;',
'not a valve, not a wall, not an intersection is there anywhere in nature, but one blood rolls uninterruptedly an endless circulation through all men, as the water of the globe is all one sea, and, truly seen, its tide is one.',
'Let man then learn the revelation of all nature and all thought to his heart; this, namely; that the Highest dwells with him; that the sources of nature are in his own mind, if the sentiment of duty is there.',
'But if he would know what the great God speaketh, he must ‘go into his closet and shut the door,’ as Jesus said.',
'God will not make himself manifest to cowards.',
'He must greatly listen to himself, withdrawing himself from all the accents of other men’s devotion.',
'Even their prayers are hurtful to him, until he have made his own.',
'Our religion vulgarly stands on numbers of believers.',
'Whenever the appeal is made,—no matter how indirectly,—to numbers, proclamation is then and there made that religion is not.',
'He that finds God a sweet enveloping thought to him never counts his company.',
'When I sit in that presence, who shall dare to come in?',
'When I rest in perfect humility, when I burn with pure love, what can Calvin or Swedenborg say?',
'It makes no difference whether the appeal is to numbers or to one.',
'The faith that stands on authority is not faith.',
'The reliance on authority measures the decline of religion, the withdrawal of the soul.',
'The position men have given to Jesus, now for many centuries of history, is a position of authority.',
'It characterizes themselves.',
'It cannot alter the eternal facts.',
'Great is the soul, and plain.',
'It is no flatterer, it is no follower; it never appeals from itself.',
'It believes in itself.',
'Before the immense possibilities of man all mere experience, all past biography, however spotless and sainted, shrinks away.',
'Before that heaven which our presentiments foreshow us, we cannot easily praise any form of life we have seen or read of.',
'We not only affirm that we have few great men, but, absolutely speaking, that we have none; that we have no history, no record of any character or mode of living that entirely contents us.',
'The saints and demigods whom history worships we are constrained to accept with a grain of allowance.',
'Though in our lonely hours we draw a new strength out of their memory, yet, pressed on our attention, as they are by the thoughtless and customary, they fatigue and invade.',
'The soul gives itself, alone, original and pure, to the Lonely, Original and Pure, who, on that condition, gladly inhabits, leads and speaks through it.',
'Then is it glad, young and nimble.',
'It is not wise, but it sees through all things.',
'It is not called religious, but it is innocent.',
'It calls the light its own, and feels that the grass grows and the stone falls by a law inferior to, and dependent on, its nature.',
'Behold, it saith, I am born into the great, the universal mind.',
'I, the imperfect, adore my own Perfect.',
'I am somehow receptive of the great soul, and thereby I do Overlook the sun and the stars and feel them to be the fair accidents and effects which change and pass.',
'More and more the surges of everlasting nature enter into me, and I become public and human in my regards and actions.',
'So come I to live in thoughts and act with energies which are immortal.',
'Thus revering the soul, and learning, as the ancient said, that “its beauty is immense,” man will come to see that the world is the perennial miracle which the soul worketh, and be less astonished at particular wonders;',
'he will learn that there is no profane history;',
'that all history is sacred;',
'that the universe is represented in an atom, in a moment of time.',
'He will weave no longer a spotted life of shreds and patches, but he will live with a divine unity.',
'He will cease from what is base and frivolous in his life and be content with all places and with any service he can render.',
'He will calmly front the morrow in the negligency of that trust which carries God with it and so hath already the whole future in the bottom of the heart.',
'X: CIRCLES',
'Nature centres into balls,',
'And her proud ephemerals,',
'Fast to surface and outside,',
'Scan the profile of the sphere;',
'Knew they what that signified,',
'A new genesis were here.',
'The eye is the first circle; the horizon which it forms is the second; and throughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end.',
'It is the highest emblem in the cipher of the world.',
'St. Augustine described the nature of God as a circle whose centre was everywhere and its circumference nowhere.',
'We are all our lifetime reading the copious sense of this first of forms.',
'One moral we have already deduced, in considering the circular or compensatory character of every human action.',
'Another analogy we shall now trace, that every action admits of being outdone.',
'Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around every circle another can be drawn; that there is no end in nature, but every end is a beginning; that there is always another dawn risen on mid-noon, and under every deep a lower deep opens.',
'This fact,',
'as far as it symbolizes the moral fact of the Unattainable, the flying Perfect, around which the hands of man can never meet, at once the inspirer and the condemner of every success, may conveniently serve us to connect many illustrations of human power in every department.',
'There are no fixtures in nature.',
'The universe is fluid and volatile.',
'Permanence is but a word of degrees.',
'Our globe seen by God is a transparent law, not a mass of facts.',
'The law dissolves the fact and holds it fluid.',
'Our culture is the predominance of an idea which draws after it this train of cities and institutions.',
'Let us rise into another idea: they will disappear.',
'The Greek sculpture is all melted away, as if it had been statues of ice; here and there a solitary figure or fragment remaining, as we see flecks and scraps of snow left in cold dells and mountain clefts in June and July.',
'For the genius that created it creates now somewhat else.',
'The Greek letters last a little longer, but are already passing under the same sentence and tumbling into the inevitable pit which the creation of new thought opens for all that is old.',
'The new continents are built out of the ruins of an old planet; the new races fed out of the decomposition of the foregoing.',
'New arts destroy the old.',
'See the investment of capital in aqueducts made useless by hydraulics; fortifications, by gunpowder; roads and canals, by railways; sails, by steam; steam by electricity.',
'You admire this tower of granite, weathering the hurts of so many ages.',
'Yet a little waving hand built this huge wall, and that which builds is better than that which is built.',
'The hand that built can topple it down much faster.',
'Better than the hand and nimbler was the invisible thought which wrought through it; and thus ever, behind the coarse effect, is a fine cause, which, being narrowly seen, is itself the effect of a finer cause.',
'Every thing looks permanent until its secret is known.',
'A rich estate appears to women a firm and lasting fact; to a merchant, one easily created out of any materials, and easily lost.',
'An orchard, good tillage, good grounds, seem a fixture, like a gold mine, or a river, to a citizen; but to a large farmer, not much more fixed than the state of the crop.',
'Nature looks provokingly stable and secular, but it has a cause like all the rest; and when once I comprehend that, will these fields stretch so immovably wide, these leaves hang so individually considerable?',
'Permanence is a word of degrees.',
'Every thing is medial.',
'Moons are no more bounds to spiritual power than bat-balls.',
'The key to every man is his thought.',
'Sturdy and defying though he look, he has a helm which he obeys, which is the idea after which all his facts are classified.',
'He can only be reformed by showing him a new idea which commands his own.',
'The life of man is a self-evolving circle, which, from a ring imperceptibly small, rushes on all sides outwards to new and larger circles, and that without end.',
'The extent to which this generation of circles, wheel without wheel, will go, depends on the force or truth of the individual soul.',
'For it is the inert effort of each thought, having formed itself into a circular wave of circumstance,—as for instance an empire, rules of an art, a local usage, a religious rite,—to heap itself on that ridge and to solidify and hem in the life.',
'But if the soul is quick and strong it bursts over that boundary on all sides and expands another orbit on the great deep, which also runs up into a high wave, with attempt again to stop and to bind.',
'But the heart refuses to be imprisoned; in its first and narrowest pulses, it already tends outward with a vast force and to immense and innumerable expansions.',
'Every ultimate fact is only the first of a new series.',
'Every general law only a particular fact of some more general law presently to disclose itself.',
'There is no outside, no inclosing wall, no circumference to us.',
'The man finishes his story,—how good! how final! how it puts a new face on all things!',
'He fills the sky.',
'Lo! on the other side rises also a man and draws a circle around the circle we had just pronounced the outline of the sphere.',
'Then already is our first speaker not man, but only a first speaker.',
'His only redress is forthwith to draw a circle outside of his antagonist.',
'And so men do by themselves.',
'The result of to-day, which haunts the mind and cannot be escaped, will presently be abridged into a word, and the principle that seemed to explain nature will itself be included as one example of a bolder generalization.',
'In the thought of to-morrow there is a power to upheave all thy creed, all the creeds, all the literatures of the nations, and marshal thee to a heaven which no epic dream has yet depicted.',
'Every man is not so much a workman in the world as he is a suggestion of that he should be.',
'Men walk as prophecies of the next age.',
'Step by step we scale this mysterious ladder: the steps are actions; the new prospect is power.',
'Every several result is threatened and judged by that which follows.',
'Every one seems to be contradicted by the new; it is only limited by the new.',
'The new statement is always hated by the old, and, to those dwelling in the old, comes like an abyss of scepticism.',
'But the eye soon gets wonted to it, for the eye and it are effects of one cause; then its innocency and benefit appear, and presently, all its energy spent, it pales and dwindles before the revelation of the new hour.',
'Fear not the new generalization.',
'Does the fact look crass and material, threatening to degrade thy theory of spirit?',
'Resist it not; it goes to refine and raise thy theory of matter just as much.',
'There are no fixtures to men, if we appeal to consciousness.',
'Every man supposes himself not to be fully understood; and if there is any truth in him, if he rests at last on the divine soul, I see not how it can be otherwise.',
'The last chamber, the last closet, he must feel was never opened; there is always a residuum unknown, unanalyzable.',
'That is, every man believes that he has a greater possibility.',
'Our moods do not believe in each other.',
'To-day I am full of thoughts and can write what I please.',
'I see no reason why I should not have the same thought, the same power of expression, to-morrow.',
'What I write, whilst I write it, seems the most natural thing in the world; but yesterday I saw a dreary vacuity in this direction in which now I see so much; and a month hence, I doubt not, I shall wonder who he was that wrote so many continuous pages.',
'Alas for this infirm faith, this will not strenuous, this vast ebb of a vast flow!',
'I am God in nature; I am a weed by the wall.',
'The continual effort to raise himself above himself, to work a pitch above his last height, betrays itself in a man’s relations.',
'We thirst for approbation, yet cannot forgive the approver.',
'The sweet of nature is love; yet, if I have a friend I am tormented by my imperfections.',
'The love of me accuses the other party.',
'If he were high enough to slight me, then could I love him, and rise by my affection to new heights.',
'A man’s growth is seen in the successive choirs of his friends.',
'For every friend whom he loses for truth, he gains a better.',
'I thought as I walked in the woods and mused on my friends, why should I play with them this game of idolatry?',
'I know and see too well, when not voluntarily blind, the speedy limits of persons called high and worthy.',
'Rich, noble and great they are by the liberality of our speech, but truth is sad.',
'O blessed Spirit, whom I forsake for these, they are not thou!',
'Every personal consideration that we allow costs us heavenly state.',
'We sell the thrones of angels for a short and turbulent pleasure.',
'How often must we learn this lesson?',
'Men cease to interest us when we find their limitations.',
'The only sin is limitation.',
'As soon as you once come up with a man’s limitations, it is all over with him.',
'Has he talents? has he enterprise? has he knowledge?',
'It boots not.',
'Infinitely alluring and attractive was he to you yesterday, a great hope, a sea to swim in; now, you have found his shores, found it a pond, and you care not if you never see it again.',
'Each new step we take in thought reconciles twenty seemingly discordant facts, as expressions of one law.',
'Aristotle and Plato are reckoned the respective heads of two schools.',
'A wise man will see that Aristotle platonizes.',
'By going one step farther back in thought, discordant opinions are reconciled by being seen to be two extremes of one principle, and we can never go so far back as to preclude a still higher vision.',
'Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet.',
'Then all things are at risk.',
'It is as when a conflagration has broken out in a great city, and no man knows what is safe, or where it will end.',
'There is not a piece of science but its flank may be turned to-morrow; there is not any literary reputation, not the so-called eternal names of fame, that may not be revised and condemned.',
'The very hopes of man, the thoughts of his heart, the religion of nations, the manners and morals of mankind are all at the mercy of a new generalization.',
'Generalization is always a new influx of the divinity into the mind.',
'Hence the thrill that attends it.',
'Valor consists in the power of self-recovery, so that a man cannot have his flank turned, cannot be out-generalled, but put him where you will, he stands.',
'This can only be by his preferring truth to his past apprehension of truth, and his alert acceptance of it from whatever quarter; the intrepid conviction that his laws, his relations to society, his Christianity, his world, may at any time be superseded and decease.',
'There are degrees in idealism.',
'We learn first to play with it academically, as the magnet was once a toy.',
'Then we see in the heyday of youth and poetry that it may be true, that it is true in gleams and fragments.',
'Then its countenance waxes stern and grand, and we see that it must be true.',
'It now shows itself ethical and practical.',
'We learn that God is; that he is in me; and that all things are shadows of him.',
'The idealism of Berkeley is only a crude statement of the idealism of Jesus, and that again is a crude statement of the fact that all nature is the rapid efflux of goodness executing and organizing itself.',
'Much more obviously is history and the state of the world at any one time directly dependent on the intellectual classification then existing in the minds of men.',
'The things which are dear to men at this hour are so on account of the ideas which have emerged on their mental horizon, and which cause the present order of things, as a tree bears its apples.',
'A new degree of culture would instantly revolutionize the entire system of human pursuits.',
'Conversation is a game of circles.',
'In conversation we pluck up the termini which bound the common of silence on every side.',
'The parties are not to be judged by the spirit they partake and even express under this Pentecost.',
'To-morrow they will have receded from this high-water mark.',
'To-morrow you shall find them stooping under the old pack-saddles.',
'Yet let us enjoy the cloven flame whilst it glows on our walls.',
'When each new speaker strikes a new light, emancipates us from the oppression of the last speaker, to oppress us with the greatness and exclusiveness of his own thought, then yields us to another redeemer, we seem to recover our rights, to become men.',
'O, what truths profound and executable only in ages and orbs, are supposed in the announcement of every truth!',
'In common hours, society sits cold and statuesque.',
'We all stand waiting, empty,—knowing, possibly, that we can be full, surrounded by mighty symbols which are not symbols to us, but prose and trivial toys.',
'Then cometh the god and converts the statues into fiery men, and by a flash of his eye burns up the veil which shrouded all things, and the meaning of the very furniture, of cup and saucer, of chair and clock and tester, is manifest.',
'The facts which loomed so large in the fogs of yesterday,—property, climate, breeding, personal beauty and the like, have strangely changed their proportions.',
'All that we reckoned settled shakes and rattles; and literatures, cities, climates, religions, leave their foundations and dance before our eyes.',
'And yet here again see the swift circumspection!',
'Good as is discourse, silence is better, and shames it.',
'The length of the discourse indicates the distance of thought betwixt the speaker and the hearer.',
'If they were at a perfect understanding in any part, no words would be necessary thereon.',
'If at one in all parts, no words would be suffered.',
'Literature is a point outside of our hodiernal circle through which a new one may be described.',
'The use of literature is to afford us a platform whence we may command a view of our present life, a purchase by which we may move it.',
'We fill ourselves with ancient learning, install ourselves the best we can in Greek, in Punic, in Roman houses, only that we may wiselier see French, English and American houses and modes of living.',
'In like manner we see literature best from the midst of wild nature, or from the din of affairs, or from a high religion.',
'The field cannot be well seen from within the field.',
'The astronomer must have his diameter of the earth’s orbit as a base to find the parallax of any star.',
'Therefore we value the poet.',
'All the argument and all the wisdom is not in the encyclopaedia, or the treatise on metaphysics, or the Body of Divinity, but in the sonnet or the play.',
'In my daily work I incline to repeat my old steps, and do not believe in remedial force, in the power of change and reform.',
'But some Petrarch or Ariosto, filled with the new wine of his imagination, writes me an ode or a brisk romance, full of daring thought and action.',
'He smites and arouses me with his shrill tones, breaks up my whole chain of habits, and I open my eye on my own possibilities.',
'He claps wings to the sides of all the solid old lumber of the world, and I am capable once more of choosing a straight path in theory and practice.',
'We have the same need to command a view of the religion of the world.',
'We can never see Christianity from the catechism:—from the pastures, from a boat in the pond, from amidst the songs of wood-birds we possibly may.',
'Cleansed by the elemental light and wind, steeped in the sea of beautiful forms which the field offers us, we may chance to cast a right glance back upon biography.',
'Christianity is rightly dear to the best of mankind;',
'yet was there never a young philosopher whose breeding had fallen into the Christian church by whom that brave text of Paul’s was not specially prized:—“Then shall also the Son be subject unto Him who put all things under him, that God may be all in all.”',
'Let the claims and virtues of persons be never so great and welcome, the instinct of man presses eagerly onward to the impersonal and illimitable, and gladly arms itself against the dogmatism of bigots with this generous word out of the book itself.',
'The natural world may be conceived of as a system of concentric circles, and we now and then detect in nature slight dislocations which apprise us that this surface on which we now stand is not fixed, but sliding.',
'These manifold tenacious qualities, this chemistry and vegetation, these metals and animals, which seem to stand there for their own sake, are means and methods only,—are words of God, and as fugitive as other words.',
'Has the naturalist or chemist learned his craft,',
'who has explored the gravity of atoms and the elective affinities,',
'who has not yet discerned the deeper law whereof this is only a partial or approximate statement, namely that like draws to like, and that the goods which belong to you gravitate to you and need not be pursued with pains and cost?',
'Yet is that statement approximate also, and not final.',
'Omnipresence is a higher fact.',
'Not through subtle subterranean channels need friend and fact be drawn to their counterpart, but, rightly considered, these things proceed from the eternal generation of the soul.',
'Cause and effect are two sides of one fact.',
'The same law of eternal procession ranges all that we call the virtues, and extinguishes each in the light of a better.',
'The great man will not be prudent in the popular sense; all his prudence will be so much deduction from his grandeur.',
'But it behooves each to see, when he sacrifices prudence, to what god he devotes it; if to ease and pleasure, he had better be prudent still; if to a great trust, he can well spare his mule and panniers who has a winged chariot instead.',
'Geoffrey draws on his boots to go through the woods, that his feet may be safer from the bite of snakes; Aaron never thinks of such a peril.',
'In many years neither is harmed by such an accident.',
'Yet it seems to me that with every precaution you take against such an evil you put yourself into the power of the evil.',
'I suppose that the highest prudence is the lowest prudence.',
'Is this too sudden a rushing from the centre to the verge of our orbit?',
'Think how many times we shall fall back into pitiful calculations before we take up our rest in the great sentiment, or make the verge of to-day the new centre.',
'Besides, your bravest sentiment is familiar to the humblest men.',
'The poor and the low have their way of expressing the last facts of philosophy as well as you.',
'“Blessed be nothing” and “The worse things are, the better they are” are proverbs which express the transcendentalism of common life.',
'One man’s justice is another’s injustice; one man’s beauty another’s ugliness; one man’s wisdom another’s folly; as one beholds the same objects from a higher point.',
'One man thinks justice consists in paying debts, and has no measure in his abhorrence of another who is very remiss in this duty and makes the creditor wait tediously.',
'But that second man has his own way of looking at things; asks himself Which debt must I pay first, the debt to the rich, or the debt to the poor? the debt of money, or the debt of thought to mankind, of genius to nature?',
'For you, O broker, there is no other principle but arithmetic.',
'For me, commerce is of trivial import; love, faith, truth of character, the aspiration of man, these are sacred; nor can I detach one duty, like you, from all other duties, and concentrate my forces mechanically on the payment of moneys.',
'Let me live onward; you shall find that, though slower, the progress of my character will liquidate all these debts without injustice to higher claims.',
'If a man should dedicate himself to the payment of notes, would not this be injustice?',
'Does he owe no debt but money?',
'And are all claims on him to be postponed to a landlord’s or a banker’s?',
'There is no virtue which is final; all are initial.',
'The virtues of society are vices of the saint.',
'The terror of reform is the discovery that we must cast away our virtues, or what we have always esteemed such, into the same pit that has consumed our grosser vices:—',
'“Forgive his crimes, forgive his virtues too,',
'Those smaller faults, half converts to the right.”',
'It is the highest power of divine moments that they abolish our contritions also.',
'I accuse myself of sloth and unprofitableness day by day; but when these waves of God flow into me I no longer reckon lost time.',
'I no longer poorly compute my possible achievement by what remains to me of the month or the year;',
'for these moments confer a sort of omnipresence and omnipotence which asks nothing of duration, but sees that the energy of the mind is commensurate with the work to be done, without time.',
'And thus, O circular philosopher, I hear some reader exclaim, you have arrived at a fine Pyrrhonism, at an equivalence and indifferency of all actions, and would fain teach us that if we are true,',
'forsooth, our crimes may be lively stones out of which we shall construct the temple of the true God!',
'I am not careful to justify myself.',
'I own I am gladdened by seeing the predominance of the saccharine principle throughout vegetable nature,',
'and not less by beholding in morals that unrestrained inundation of the principle of good into every chink and hole that selfishness has left open, yea into selfishness and sin itself;',
'so that no evil is pure, nor hell itself without its extreme satisfactions.',
'But lest I should mislead any when I have my own head and obey my whims, let me remind the reader that I am only an experimenter.',
'Do not set the least value on what I do, or the least discredit on what I do not, as if I pretended to settle any thing as true or false.',
'I unsettle all things.',
'No facts are to me sacred; none are profane; I simply experiment, an endless seeker with no Past at my back.',
'Yet this incessant movement and progression which all things partake could never become sensible to us but by contrast to some principle of fixture or stability in the soul.',
'Whilst the eternal generation of circles proceeds, the eternal generator abides.',
'That central life is somewhat superior to creation, superior to knowledge and thought, and contains all its circles.',
'For ever it labors to create a life and thought as Large and excellent as itself, but in vain, for that which is made instructs how to make a better.',
'Thus there is no sleep, no pause, no preservation, but all things renew, germinate and spring.',
'Why should we import rags and relics into the new hour?',
'Nature abhors the old, and old age seems the only disease; all others run into this one.',
'We call it by many names,—fever, intemperance, insanity, stupidity and crime; they are all forms of old age; they are rest, conservatism, appropriation, inertia; not newness, not the way onward.',
'We grizzle every day.',
'I see no need of it.',
'Whilst we converse with what is above us, we do not grow old, but grow young.',
'Infancy, youth, receptive, aspiring, with religious eye looking upward, counts itself nothing and abandons itself to the instruction flowing from all sides.',
'But the man and woman of seventy assume to know all, they have outlived their hope, they renounce aspiration, accept the actual for the necessary and talk down to the young.',
'Let them, then, become organs of the Holy Ghost; let them be lovers; let them behold truth; and their eyes are uplifted, their wrinkles smoothed, they are perfumed again with hope and power.',
'This old age ought not to creep on a human mind.',
'In nature every moment is new; the past is always swallowed and forgotten; the coming only is sacred.',
'Nothing is secure but life, transition, the energizing spirit.',
'No love can be bound by oath or covenant to secure it against a higher love.',
'No truth so sublime but it may be trivial to-morrow in the light of new thoughts.',
'People wish to be settled; only as far as they are unsettled is there any hope for them.',
'Life is a series of surprises.',
'We do not guess to-day the mood, the pleasure, the power of to-morrow, when we are building up our being.',
'Of lower states, of acts of routine and sense, we can tell somewhat; but the masterpieces of God, the total growths and universal movements of the soul, he hideth; they are incalculable.',
'I can know that truth is divine and helpful; but how it shall help me I can have no guess, for so to be is the sole inlet of so to know.',
'The new position of the advancing man has all the powers of the old, yet has them all new.',
'It carries in its bosom all the energies of the past, yet is itself an exhalation of the morning.',
'I cast away in this new moment all my once hoarded knowledge, as vacant and vain.',
'Now, for the first time seem I to know any thing rightly.',
'The simplest words,—we do not know what they mean except when we love and aspire.',
'The difference between talents and character is adroitness to keep the old and trodden round, and power and courage to make a new road to new and better goals.',
'Character makes an overpowering present; a cheerful, determined hour, which fortifies all the company by making them see that much is possible and excellent that was not thought of.',
'Character dulls the impression of particular events.',
'When we see the conqueror we do not think much of any one battle or success.',
'We see that we had exaggerated the difficulty.',
'It was easy to him.',
'The great man is not convulsible or tormentable; events pass over him without much impression.',
'People say sometimes, ‘See what I have overcome; see how cheerful I am; see how completely I have triumphed over these black events.’',
'Not if they still remind me of the black event.',
'True conquest is the causing the calamity to fade and disappear as an early cloud of insignificant result in a history so large and advancing.',
'The one thing which we seek with insatiable desire is to forget ourselves, to be surprised out of our propriety, to lose our sempiternal memory and to do something without knowing how or why; in short to draw a new circle.',
'Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.',
'The way of life is wonderful; it is by abandonment.',
'The great moments of history are the facilities of performance through the strength of ideas, as the works of genius and religion.',
'“A man,” said Oliver Cromwell, “never rises so high as when he knows not whither he is going.”',
'Dreams and drunkenness, the use of opium and alcohol are the semblance and counterfeit of this oracular genius, and hence their dangerous attraction for men.',
'For the like reason they ask the aid of wild passions, as in gaming and war, to ape in some manner these flames and generosities of the heart.',
'XI: INTELLECT',
'Go, speed the stars of Thought',
'On to their shining goals;—',
'The sower scatters broad his seed,',
'The wheat thou strew’st be souls.',
'Every substance is negatively electric to that which stands above it in the chemical tables, positively to that which stands below it.',
'Water dissolves wood and iron and salt; air dissolves water; electric fire dissolves air, but the intellect dissolves fire, gravity, laws, method, and the subtlest unnamed relations of nature in its resistless menstruum.',
'Intellect lies behind genius, which is intellect constructive.',
'Intellect is the simple power anterior to all action or construction.',
'Gladly would I unfold in calm degrees a natural history of the intellect, but what man has yet been able to mark the steps and boundaries of that transparent essence?',
'The first questions are always to be asked, and the wisest doctor is gravelled by the inquisitiveness of a child.',
'How can we speak of the action of the mind under any divisions, as of its knowledge, of its ethics, of its works, and so forth, since it melts will into perception, knowledge into act?',
'Each becomes the other.',
'Itself alone is.',
'Its vision is not like the vision of the eye, but is union with the things known.',
'Intellect and intellection signify to the common ear consideration of abstract truth.',
'The considerations of time and place, of you and me, of profit and hurt tyrannize over most men’s minds.',
'Intellect separates the fact considered, from you, from all local and personal reference, and discerns it as if it existed for its own sake.',
'Heraclitus looked upon the affections as dense and colored mists.',
'In the fog of good and evil affections it is hard for man to walk forward in a straight line.',
'Intellect is void of affection and sees an object as it stands in the light of science, cool and disengaged.',
'The intellect goes out of the individual, floats over its own personality, and regards it as a fact, and not as I and mine.',
'He who is immersed in what concerns person or place cannot see the problem of existence.',
'This the intellect always ponders.',
'Nature shows all things formed and bound.',
'The intellect pierces the form, overleaps the wall, detects intrinsic likeness between remote things and reduces all things into a few principles.',
'The making a fact the subject of thought raises it.',
'All that mass of mental and moral phenomena which we do not make objects of voluntary thought, come within the power of fortune; they constitute the circumstance of daily life; they are subject to change, to fear, and hope.',
'Every man beholds his human condition with a degree of melancholy.',
'As a ship aground is battered by the waves, so man, imprisoned in mortal life, lies open to the mercy of coming events.',
'But a truth, separated by the intellect, is no longer a subject of destiny.',
'We behold it as a god upraised above care and fear.',
'And so any fact in our life, or any record of our fancies or reflections, disentangled from the web of our unconsciousness, becomes an object impersonal and immortal.',
'It is the past restored, but embalmed.',
'A better art than that of Egypt has taken fear and corruption out of it.',
'It is eviscerated of care.',
'It is offered for science.',
'What is addressed to us for contemplation does not threaten us but makes us intellectual beings.',
'The growth of the intellect is spontaneous in every expansion.',
'The mind that grows could not predict the times, the means, the mode of that spontaneity.',
'God enters by a private door into every individual.',
'Long prior to the age of reflection is the thinking of the mind.',
'Out of darkness it came insensibly into the marvellous light of to-day.',
'In the period of infancy it accepted and disposed of all impressions from the surrounding creation after its own way.',
'Whatever any mind doth or saith is after a law; and this native law remains over it after it has come to reflection or conscious thought.',
'In the most worn, pedantic, introverted self-tormenter’s life, the greatest part is incalculable by him, unforeseen, unimaginable, and must be, until he can take himself up by his own ears.',
'What am I?',
'What has my will done to make me that I am?',
'Nothing.',
'I have been floated into this thought, this hour, this connection of events, by secret currents of might and mind, and my ingenuity and wilfulness have not thwarted, have not aided to an appreciable degree.',
'Our spontaneous action is always the best.',
'You cannot with your best deliberation and heed come so close to any question as your spontaneous glance shall bring you, whilst you rise from your bed, or walk abroad in the morning after meditating the matter before sleep on the previous night.',
'Our thinking is a pious reception.',
'Our truth of thought is therefore vitiated as much by too violent direction given by our will, as by too great negligence.',
'We do not determine what we will think.',
'We only open our senses, clear away as we can all obstruction from the fact, and suffer the intellect to see.',
'We have little control over our thoughts.',
'We are the prisoners of ideas.',
'They catch us up for moments into their heaven and so fully engage us that we take no thought for the morrow, gaze like children, without an effort to make them our own.',
'By and by we fall out of that rapture, bethink us where we have been, what we have seen, and repeat as truly as we can what we have beheld.',
'As far as we can recall these ecstasies we carry away in the ineffaceable memory the result, and all men and all the ages confirm it.',
'It is called Truth.',
'But the moment we cease to report and attempt to correct and contrive, it is not truth.',
'If we consider what persons have stimulated and profited us, we shall perceive the superiority of the spontaneous or intuitive principle over the arithmetical or logical.',
'The first contains the second, but virtual and latent.',
'We want in every man a long logic; we cannot pardon the absence of it, but it must not be spoken.',
'Logic is the procession or proportionate unfolding of the intuition; but its virtue is as silent method; the moment it would appear as propositions and have a separate value it is worthless.',
'In every man’s mind, some images, words and facts remain, without effort on his part to imprint them, which others forget, and afterwards these illustrate to him important laws.',
'All our progress is an unfolding, like the vegetable bud.',
'You have first an instinct, then an opinion, then a knowledge, as the plant has root, bud and fruit.',
'Trust the instinct to the end, though you can render no reason.',
'It is vain to hurry it.',
'By trusting it to the end, it shall ripen into truth and you shall know why you believe.',
'Each mind has its own method.',
'A true man never acquires after college rules.',
'What you have aggregated in a natural manner surprises and delights when it is produced.',
'For we cannot oversee each other’s secret.',
'And hence the differences between men in natural endowment are insignificant in comparison with their common wealth.',
'Do you think the porter and the cook have no anecdotes, no experiences, no wonders for you?',
'Every body knows as much as the savant.',
'The walls of rude minds are scrawled all over with facts, with thoughts.',
'They shall one day bring a lantern and read the inscriptions.',
'Every man, in the degree in which he has wit and culture, finds his curiosity inflamed concerning the modes of living and thinking of other men, and especially of those classes whose minds have not been subdued by the drill of school education.',
'This instinctive action never ceases in a healthy mind, but becomes richer and more frequent in its informations through all states of culture.',
'At last comes the era of reflection, when we not only observe, but take pains to observe;',
'when we of set purpose sit down to consider an abstract truth;',
'when we keep the mind’s eye open whilst we converse, whilst we read, whilst we act, intent to learn the secret law of some class of facts.',
'What is the hardest task in the world?',
'To think.',
'I would put myself in the attitude to look in the eye an abstract truth, and I cannot.',
'I blench and withdraw on this side and on that.',
'I seem to know what he meant who said, No man can see God face to face and live.',
'For example, a man explores the basis of civil government.',
'Let him intend his mind without respite, without rest, in one direction.',
'His best heed long time avails him nothing.',
'Yet thoughts are flitting before him.',
'We all but apprehend, we dimly forebode the truth.',
'We say I will walk abroad, and the truth will take form and clearness to me.',
'We go forth, but cannot find it.',
'It seems as if we needed only the stillness and composed attitude of the library to seize the thought.',
'But we come in, and are as far from it as at first.',
'Then, in a moment, and unannounced, the truth appears.',
'A certain wandering light appears, and is the distinction, the principle, we wanted.',
'But the oracle comes because we had previously laid siege to the shrine.',
'It seems as if the law of the intellect resembled that law of nature by which we now inspire, now expire the breath; by which the heart now draws in, then hurls out the blood,—the law of undulation.',
'So now you must labor with your brains, and now you must forbear your activity and see what the great Soul showeth.',
'The immortality of man is as legitimately preached from the intellections as from the moral volitions.',
'Every intellection is mainly prospective.',
'Its present value is its least.',
'Inspect what delights you in Plutarch, in Shakspeare, in Cervantes.',
'Each truth that a writer acquires is a lantern, which he turns full on what facts and thoughts lay already in his mind, and behold, all the mats and rubbish which had littered his garret become precious.',
'Every trivial fact in his private biography becomes an illustration of this new principle, revisits the day, and delights all men by its piquancy and new charm.',
'Men say, Where did he get this? and think there was something divine in his life.',
'But no; they have myriads of facts just as good, would they only get a lamp to ransack their attics withal.',
'We are all wise.',
'The difference between persons is not in wisdom but in art.',
'I knew, in an academical club, a person who always deferred to me; who, seeing my whim for writing, fancied that my experiences had somewhat superior; whilst I saw that his experiences were as good as mine.',
'Give them to me and I would make the same use of them.',
'He held the old; he holds the new; I had the habit of tacking together the old and the new which he did not use to exercise.',
'This may hold in the great examples.',
'Perhaps if we should meet Shakspeare we should not be conscious of any steep inferiority; no, but of a great equality,—only that he possessed a strange skill of using, of classifying, his facts, which we lacked.',
'For notwithstanding our utter incapacity to produce anything like Hamlet and Othello, see the perfect reception this wit and immense knowledge of life and liquid eloquence find in us all.',
'If you gather apples in the sunshine, or make hay, or hoe corn, and then retire within doors and shut your eyes and press them with your hand,',
'you shall still see apples hanging in the bright light with boughs and leaves thereto, or the tasselled grass, or the corn-flags, and this for five or six hours afterwards.',
'There lie the impressions on the retentive organ, though you knew it not.',
'So lies the whole series of natural images with which your life has made you acquainted, in your memory, though you know it not; and a thrill of passion flashes light on their dark chamber, and the active power seizes instantly the fit image, as the word of its momentary thought.',
'It is long ere we discover how rich we are.',
'Our history, we are sure, is quite tame: we have nothing to write, nothing to infer.',
'But our wiser years still run back to the despised recollections of childhood, and always we are fishing up some wonderful article out of that pond;',
'until by and by we begin to suspect that the biography of the one foolish person we know is, in reality, nothing less than the miniature paraphrase of the hundred volumes of the Universal History.',
'In the intellect constructive, which we popularly designate by the word Genius, we observe the same balance of two elements as in intellect receptive.',
'The constructive intellect produces thoughts, sentences, poems, plans, designs, systems.',
'It is the generation of the mind, the marriage of thought with nature.',
'To genius must always go two gifts, the thought and the publication.',
'The first is revelation, always a miracle, which no frequency of occurrence or incessant study can ever familiarize, but which must always leave the inquirer stupid with wonder.',
'It is the advent of truth into the world, a form of thought now for the first time bursting into the universe, a child of the old eternal soul, a piece of genuine and immeasurable greatness.',
'It seems, for the time, to inherit all that has yet existed and to dictate to the unborn.',
'It affects every thought of man and goes to fashion every institution.',
'But to make it available it needs a vehicle or art by which it is conveyed to men.',
'To be communicable it must become picture or sensible object.',
'We must learn the language of facts.',
'The most wonderful inspirations die with their subject if he has no hand to paint them to the senses.',
'The ray of light passes invisible through space and only when it falls on an object is it seen.',
'When the spiritual energy is directed on something outward, then it is a thought.',
'The relation between it and you first makes you, the value of you, apparent to me.',
'The rich inventive genius of the painter must be smothered and lost for want of the power of drawing, and in our happy hours we should be inexhaustible poets if once we could break through the silence into adequate rhyme.',
'As all men have some access to primary truth, so all have some art or power of communication in their head, but only in the artist does it descend into the hand.',
'There is an inequality, whose laws we do not yet know, between two men and between two moments of the same man, in respect to this faculty.',
'In common hours we have the same facts as in the uncommon or inspired, but they do not sit for their portraits; they are not detached, but lie in a web.',
'The thought of genius is spontaneous; but the power of picture or expression, in the most enriched and flowing nature, implies a mixture of will, a certain control over the spontaneous states, without which no production is possible.',
'It is a conversion of all nature into the rhetoric of thought, under the eye of judgment, with a strenuous exercise of choice.',
'And yet the imaginative vocabulary seems to be spontaneous also.',
'It does not flow from experience only or mainly, but from a richer source.',
'Not by any conscious imitation of particular forms are the grand strokes of the painter executed, but by repairing to the fountain-head of all forms in his mind.',
'Who is the first drawing-master?',
'Without instruction we know very well the ideal of the human form.',
'A child knows if an arm or a leg be distorted in a picture; if the attitude be natural or grand or mean; though he has never received any instruction in drawing or heard any conversation on the subject, nor can himself draw with correctness a single feature.',
'A good form strikes all eyes pleasantly, long before they have any science on the subject, and a beautiful face sets twenty hearts in palpitation, prior to all consideration of the mechanical proportions of the features and head.',
'We may owe to dreams some light on the fountain of this skill; for as soon as we let our will go and let the unconscious states ensue, see what cunning draughtsmen we are!',
'We entertain ourselves with wonderful forms of men, of women, of animals, of gardens, of woods and of monsters, and the mystic pencil wherewith we then draw has no awkwardness or inexperience, no meagreness or poverty;',
'it can design well and group well;',
'its composition is full of art, its colors are well laid on and the whole canvas which it paints is lifelike and apt to touch us with terror, with tenderness, with desire and with grief.',
'Neither are the artist’s copies from experience ever mere copies, but always touched and softened by tints from this ideal domain.',
'The conditions essential to a constructive mind do not appear to be so often combined but that a good sentence or verse remains fresh and memorable for a long time.',
'Yet when we write with ease and come out into the free air of thought, we seem to be assured that nothing is easier than to continue this communication at pleasure.',
'Up, down, around, the kingdom of thought has no inclosures, but the Muse makes us free of her city.',
'Well, the world has a million writers.',
'One would think then that good thought would be as familiar as air and water, and the gifts of each new hour would exclude the last.',
'Yet we can count all our good books; nay, I remember any beautiful verse for twenty years.',
'It is true that the discerning intellect of the world is always much in advance of the creative, so that there are many competent judges of the best book, and few writers of the best books.',
'But some of the conditions of intellectual construction are of rare occurrence.',
'The intellect is a whole and demands integrity in every work.',
'This is resisted equally by a man’s devotion to a single thought and by his ambition to combine too many.',
'Truth is our element of life, yet if a man fasten his attention on a single aspect of truth and apply himself to that alone for a long time, the truth becomes distorted and not itself but falsehood;',
'herein resembling the air, which is our natural element, and the breath of our nostrils, but if a stream of the same be directed on the body for a time, it causes cold, fever, and even death.',
'How wearisome the grammarian, the phrenologist, the political or religious fanatic, or indeed any possessed mortal whose balance is lost by the exaggeration of a single topic.',
'It is incipient insanity.',
'Every thought is a prison also.',
'I cannot see what you see, because I am caught up by a strong wind and blown so far in one direction that I am out of the hoop of your horizon.',
'Is it any better if the student, to avoid this offence, and to liberalize himself, aims to make a mechanical whole of history, or science, or philosophy, by a numerical addition of all the facts that fall within his vision?',
'The world refuses to be analyzed by addition and subtraction.',
'When we are young we spend much time and pains in filling our note-books with all definitions of Religion, Love, Poetry, Politics, Art,',
'in the hope that in the course of a few years we shall have condensed into our encyclopaedia the net value of all the theories at which the world has yet arrived.',
'But year after year our tables get no completeness, and at last we discover that our curve is a parabola, whose arcs will never meet.',
'Neither by detachment neither by aggregation is the integrity of the intellect transmitted to its works, but by a vigilance which brings the intellect in its greatness and best state to operate every moment.',
'It must have the same wholeness which nature has.',
'Although no diligence can rebuild the universe in a model by the best accumulation or disposition of details, yet does the world reappear in miniature in every event, so that all the laws of nature may be read in the smallest fact.',
'The intellect must have the like perfection in its apprehension and in its works.',
'For this reason, an index or mercury of intellectual proficiency is the perception of identity.',
'We talk with accomplished persons who appear to be strangers in nature.',
'The cloud, the tree, the turf, the bird are not theirs, have nothing of them; the world is only their lodging and table.',
'But the poet, whose verses are to be spheral and complete, is one whom Nature cannot deceive, whatsoever face of strangeness she may put on.',
'He feels a strict consanguinity, and detects more likeness than variety in all her changes.',
'We are stung by the desire for new thought; but when we receive a new thought it is only the old thought with a new face, and though we make it our own we instantly crave another; we are not really enriched.',
'For the truth was in us before it was reflected to us from natural objects; and the profound genius will cast the likeness of all creatures into every product of his wit.',
'But if the constructive powers are rare and it is given to few men to be poets, yet every man is a receiver of this descending holy ghost, and may well study the laws of its influx.',
'Exactly parallel is the whole rule of intellectual duty to the rule of moral duty.',
'A self-denial no less austere than the saint’s is demanded of the scholar.',
'He must worship truth, and forego all things for that, and choose defeat and pain, so that his treasure in thought is thereby augmented.',
'God offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose.',
'Take which you please,—you can never have both.',
'Between these, as a pendulum, man oscillates.',
'He in whom the love of repose predominates will accept the first creed, the first philosophy, the first political party he meets,—most likely his father’s.',
'He gets rest, commodity, and reputation; but he shuts the door of truth.',
'He in whom the love of truth predominates will keep himself aloof from all moorings, and afloat.',
'He will abstain from dogmatism, and recognize all the opposite negations between which, as walls, his being is swung.',
'He submits to the inconvenience of suspense and imperfect opinion, but he is a candidate for truth, as the other is not, and respects the highest law of his being.',
'The circle of the green earth he must measure with his shoes to find the man who can yield him truth.',
'He shall then know that there is somewhat more blessed and great in hearing than in speaking.',
'Happy is the hearing man; unhappy the speaking man.',
'As long as I hear truth I am bathed by a beautiful element and am not conscious of any limits to my nature.',
'The suggestions are thousandfold that I hear and see.',
'The waters of the great deep have ingress and egress to the soul.',
'But if I speak, I define, I confine and am less.',
'When Socrates speaks, Lysis and Menexenus are afflicted by no shame that they do not speak.',
'They also are good.',
'He likewise defers to them, loves them, whilst he speaks.',
'Because a true and natural man contains and is the same truth which an eloquent man articulates; but in the eloquent man, because he can articulate it, it seems something the less to reside, and he turns to these silent beautiful with the more inclination and respect.',
'The ancient sentence said, Let us be silent, for so are the gods.',
'Silence is a solvent that destroys personality, and gives us leave to be great and universal.',
'Every man’s progress is through a succession of teachers, each of whom seems at the time to have a superlative influence, but it at last gives place to a new.',
'Frankly let him accept it all.',
'Jesus says, Leave father, mother, house and lands, and follow me.',
'Who leaves all, receives more.',
'This is as true intellectually as morally.',
'Each new mind we approach seems to require an abdication of all our past and present possessions.',
'A new doctrine seems at first a subversion of all our opinions, tastes, and manner of living.',
'Such has Swedenborg, such has Kant, such has Coleridge, such has Hegel or his interpreter Cousin seemed to many young men in this country.',
'Take thankfully and heartily all they can give.',
'Exhaust them, wrestle with them, let them not go until their blessing be won, and after a short season the dismay will be overpast, the excess of influence withdrawn, and they will be no longer an alarming meteor,',
'but one more bright star shining serenely in your heaven and blending its light with all your day.',
'But whilst he gives himself up unreservedly to that which draws him, because that is his own, he is to refuse himself to that which draws him not, whatsoever fame and authority may attend it, because it is not his own.',
'Entire self-reliance belongs to the intellect.',
'One soul is a counterpoise of all souls, as a capillary column of water is a balance for the sea.',
'It must treat things and books and sovereign genius as itself also a sovereign.',
'If Æschylus be that man he is taken for, he has not yet done his office when he has educated the learned of Europe for a thousand years.',
'He is now to approve himself a master of delight to me also.',
'If he cannot do that, all his fame shall avail him nothing with me.',
'I were a fool not to sacrifice a thousand Æschyluses to my intellectual integrity.',
'Especially take the same ground in regard to abstract truth, the science of the mind.',
'The Bacon, the Spinoza, the Hume, Schelling, Kant, or whosoever propounds to you a philosophy of the mind, is only a more or less awkward translator of things in your consciousness which you have also your way of seeing, perhaps of denominating.',
'Say then, instead of too timidly poring into his obscure sense, that he has not succeeded in rendering back to you your consciousness.',
'He has not succeeded; now let another try.',
'If Plato cannot, perhaps Spinoza will.',
'If Spinoza cannot, then perhaps Kant.',
'Anyhow, when at last it is done, you will find it is no recondite, but a simple, natural, common state which the writer restores to you.',
'But let us end these didactics.',
'I will not, though the subject might provoke it, speak to the open question between Truth and Love.',
'I shall not presume to interfere in the old politics of the skies;—“The cherubim know most; the seraphim love most.”',
'The gods shall settle their own quarrels.',
'But I cannot recite, even thus rudely, laws of the intellect, without remembering that lofty and sequestered class of men who have been its prophets and oracles, the high-priesthood of the pure reason, the Trismegisti, the expounders of the principles of thought from age to age.',
'When at long intervals we turn over their abstruse pages, wonderful seems the calm and grand air of these few, these great spiritual lords who have walked in the world,—',
'these of the old religion,—',
'dwelling in a worship which makes the sanctities of Christianity look parvenues and popular;',
'for “persuasion is in soul, but necessity is in intellect.”',
'This band of grandees, Hermes, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Plato, Plotinus, Olympiodorus, Proclus, Synesius and the rest, have somewhat so vast in their logic,',
'so primary in their thinking, that it seems antecedent to all the ordinary distinctions of rhetoric and literature, and to be at once poetry and music and dancing and astronomy and mathematics.',
'I am present at the sowing of the seed of the world.',
'With a geometry of sunbeams the soul lays the foundations of nature.',
'The truth and grandeur of their thought is proved by its scope and applicability, for it commands the entire schedule and inventory of things for its illustration.',
'But what marks its elevation and has even a comic look to us, is the innocent serenity with which these babe-like Jupiters sit in their clouds, and from age to age prattle to each other and to no contemporary.',
'Well assured that their speech is intelligible and the most natural thing in the world, they add thesis to thesis, without a moment’s heed of the universal astonishment of the human race below, who do not comprehend their plainest argument;',
'nor do they ever relent so much as to insert a popular or explaining sentence, nor testify the least displeasure or petulance at the dulness of their amazed auditory.',
'The angels are so enamored of the language that is spoken in heaven that they will not distort their lips with the hissing and unmusical dialects of men, but speak their own, whether there be any who understand it or not.',
'XII: ART',
'Give to barrows trays and pans',
'Grace and glimmer of romance,',
'Bring the moonlight into noon',
'Hid in gleaming piles of stone;',
'On the city’s paved street',
'Plant gardens lined with lilac sweet,',
'Let spouting fountains cool the air,',
'Singing in the sun-baked square.',
'Let statue, picture, park and hall,',
'Ballad, flag and festival,',
'The past restore, the day adorn',
'And make each morrow a new morn',
'So shall the drudge in dusty frock',
'Spy behind the city clock',
'Retinues of airy kings,',
'Skirts of angels, starry wings,',
'His fathers shining in bright fables,',
'His children fed at heavenly tables.',
'’Tis the privilege of Art',
'Thus to play its cheerful part,',
'Man in Earth to acclimate',
'And bend the exile to his fate,',
'And, moulded of one element',
'With the days and firmament,',
'Teach him on these as stairs to climb',
'And live on even terms with Time;',
'Whilst upper life the slender rill',
'Of human sense doth overfill.',
'Because the soul is progressive, it never quite repeats itself, but in every act attempts the production of a new and fairer whole.',
'This appears in works both of the useful and the fine arts, if we employ the popular distinction of works according to their aim either at use or beauty.',
'Thus in our fine arts, not imitation but creation is the aim.',
'In landscapes the painter should give the suggestion of a fairer creation than we know.',
'The details, the prose of nature he should omit and give us only the spirit and splendor.',
'He should know that the landscape has beauty for his eye because it expresses a thought which is to him good;',
'and this because the same power which sees through his eyes is seen in that spectacle;',
'and he will come to value the expression of nature and not nature itself, and so exalt in his copy the features that please him.',
'He will give the gloom of gloom and the sunshine of sunshine.',
'In a portrait he must inscribe the character and not the features, and must esteem the man who sits to him as himself only an imperfect picture or likeness of the aspiring original within.',
'What is that abridgment and selection we observe in all spiritual activity, but itself the creative impulse? for it is the inlet of that higher illumination which teaches to convey a larger sense by simpler symbols.',
'What is a man but nature’s finer success in self-explication?',
'What is a man but a finer and compacter landscape than the horizon figures,—',
'nature’s eclecticism? and what is his speech, his love of painting, love of nature, but a still finer success,—',
'all the weary miles and tons of space and bulk left out, and the spirit or moral of it contracted into a musical word, or the most cunning stroke of the pencil?',
'But the artist must employ the symbols in use in his day and nation to convey his enlarged sense to his fellow-men.',
'Thus the new in art is always formed out of the old.',
'The Genius of the Hour sets his ineffaceable seal on the work and gives it an inexpressible charm for the imagination.',
'As far as the spiritual character of the period overpowers the artist and finds expression in his work, so far it will retain a certain grandeur, and will represent to future beholders the Unknown, the Inevitable, the Divine.',
'No man can quite exclude this element of Necessity from his labor.',
'No man can quite emancipate himself from his age and country, or produce a model in which the education, the religion, the politics, usages and arts of his times shall have no share.',
'Though he were never so original, never so wilful and fantastic, he cannot wipe out of his work every trace of the thoughts amidst which it grew.',
'The very avoidance betrays the usage he avoids.',
'Above his will and out of his sight he is necessitated by the air he breathes and the idea on which he and his contemporaries live and toil, to share the manner of his times, without knowing what that manner is.',
'Now that which is inevitable in the work has a higher charm than individual talent can ever give, inasmuch as the artist’s pen or chisel seems to have been held and guided by a gigantic hand to inscribe a line in the history of the human race.',
'This circumstance gives a value to the Egyptian hieroglyphics, to the Indian, Chinese and Mexican idols, however gross and shapeless.',
'They denote the height of the human soul in that hour, and were not fantastic, but sprung from a necessity as deep as the world.',
'Shall I now add that the whole extant product of the plastic arts has herein its highest value, as history; as a stroke drawn in the portrait of that fate, perfect and beautiful, according to whose ordinations all beings advance to their beatitude?',
'Thus, historically viewed, it has been the office of art to educate the perception of beauty.',
'We are immersed in beauty, but our eyes have no clear vision.',
'It needs, by the exhibition of single traits, to assist and lead the dormant taste.',
'We carve and paint, or we behold what is carved and painted, as students of the mystery of Form.',
'The virtue of art lies in detachment, in sequestering one object from the embarrassing variety.',
'Until one thing comes out from the connection of things, there can be enjoyment, contemplation, but no thought.',
'Our happiness and unhappiness are unproductive.',
'The infant lies in a pleasing trance, but his individual character and his practical power depend on his daily progress in the separation of things, and dealing with one at a time.',
'Love and all the passions concentrate all existence around a single form.',
'It is the habit of certain minds to give an all-excluding fulness to the object, the thought, the word, they alight upon, and to make that for the time the deputy of the world.',
'These are the artists, the orators, the leaders of society.',
'The power to detach and to magnify by detaching is the essence of rhetoric in the hands of the orator and the poet.',
'This rhetoric, or power to fix the momentary eminency of an object,—so remarkable in Burke, in Byron, in Carlyle,—the painter and sculptor exhibit in color and in stone.',
'The power depends on the depth of the artist’s insight of that object he contemplates.',
'For every object has its roots in central nature, and may of course be so exhibited to us as to represent the world.',
'Therefore each work of genius is the tyrant of the hour and concentrates attention on itself.',
'For the time, it is the only thing worth naming to do that,—be it a sonnet, an opera, a landscape, a statue, an oration, the plan of a temple, of a campaign, or of a voyage of discovery.',
'Presently we pass to some other object, which rounds itself into a whole as did the first; for example a well-laid garden; and nothing seems worth doing but the laying out of gardens.',
'I should think fire the best thing in the world, if I were not acquainted with air, and water, and earth.',
'For it is the right and property of all natural objects, of all genuine talents, of all native properties whatsoever, to be for their moment the top of the world.',
'A squirrel leaping from bough to bough and making the Wood but one wide tree for his pleasure, fills the eye not less than a lion,—is beautiful, self-sufficing, and stands then and there for nature.',
'A good ballad draws my ear and heart whilst I listen, as much as an epic has done before.',
'A dog, drawn by a master, or a litter of pigs, satisfies and is a reality not less than the frescoes of Angelo.',
'From this succession of excellent objects we learn at last the immensity of the world, the opulence of human nature, which can run out to infinitude in any direction.',
'But I also learn that what astonished and fascinated me in the first work astonished me in the second work also; that excellence of all things is one.',
'The office of painting and sculpture seems to be merely initial.',
'The best pictures can easily tell us their last secret.',
'The best pictures are rude draughts of a few of the miraculous dots and lines and dyes which make up the ever-changing “landscape with figures” amidst which we dwell.',
'Painting seems to be to the eye what dancing is to the limbs.',
'When that has educated the frame to self-possession, to nimbleness, to grace, the steps of the dancing-master are better forgotten;',
'so painting teaches me the splendor of color and the expression of form, and as I see many pictures and higher genius in the art, I see the boundless opulence of the pencil, the indifferency in which the artist stands free to choose out of the possible forms.',
'If he can draw every thing, why draw any thing? and then is my eye opened to the eternal picture which nature paints in the street, with moving men and children, beggars and fine ladies, draped in red and green and blue and gray;',
'long-haired, grizzled, white-faced, black-faced, wrinkled, giant, dwarf, expanded, elfish,—capped and based by heaven, earth and sea.',
'A gallery of sculpture teaches more austerely the same lesson.',
'As picture teaches the coloring, so sculpture the anatomy of form.',
'When I have seen fine statues and afterwards enter a public assembly, I understand well what he meant who said, “When I have been reading Homer, all men look like giants.”',
'I too see that painting and sculpture are gymnastics of the eye, its training to the niceties and curiosities of its function.',
'There is no statue like this living man, with his infinite advantage over all ideal sculpture, of perpetual variety.',
'What a gallery of art have I here!',
'No mannerist made these varied groups and diverse original single figures.',
'Here is the artist himself improvising, grim and glad, at his block.',
'Now one thought strikes him, now another, and with each moment he alters the whole air, attitude and expression of his clay.',
'Away with your nonsense of oil and easels, of marble and chisels; except to open your eyes to the masteries of eternal art, they are hypocritical rubbish.',
'The reference of all production at last to an aboriginal Power explains the traits common to all works of the highest art,—that they are universally intelligible; that they restore to us the simplest states of mind, and are religious.',
'Since what skill is therein shown is the reappearance of the original soul, a jet of pure light, it should produce a similar impression to that made by natural objects.',
'In happy hours, nature appears to us one with art; art perfected,—the work of genius.',
'And the individual, in whom simple tastes and susceptibility to all the great human influences overpower the accidents of a local and special culture, is the best critic of art.',
'Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us, or we find it not.',
'The best of beauty is a finer charm than skill in surfaces, in outlines, or rules of art can ever teach, namely a radiation from the work of art of human character,—',
'a wonderful expression through stone, or canvas, or musical sound, of the deepest and simplest attributes of our nature, and therefore most intelligible at last to those souls which have these attributes.',
'In the sculptures of the Greeks, in the masonry of the Romans, and in the pictures of the Tuscan and Venetian masters, the highest charm is the universal language they speak.',
'A confession of moral nature, of purity, love, and hope, breathes from them all.',
'That which we carry to them, the same we bring back more fairly illustrated in the memory.',
'The traveller who visits the Vatican, and passes from chamber to chamber through galleries of statues, vases, sarcophagi and candelabra, through all forms of beauty cut in the richest materials,',
'is in danger of forgetting the simplicity of the principles out of which they all sprung, and that they had their origin from thoughts and laws in his own breast.',
'He studies the technical rules on these wonderful remains, but forgets that these works were not always thus constellated;',
'that they are the contributions of many ages and many countries;',
'that each came out of the solitary workshop of one artist, who toiled perhaps in ignorance of the existence of other sculpture, created his work without other model save life, household life, and the sweet and smart of personal relations, of beating hearts, and meeting eyes;',
'of poverty and necessity and hope and fear.',
'These were his inspirations, and these are the effects he carries home to your heart and mind.',
'In proportion to his force, the artist will find in his work an outlet for his proper character.',
'He must not be in any manner pinched or hindered by his material, but through his necessity of imparting himself the adamant will be wax in his hands, and will allow an adequate communication of himself, in his full stature and proportion.',
'He need not cumber himself with a conventional nature and culture, nor ask what is the mode in Rome or in Paris,',
'but that house and weather and manner of living which poverty and the fate of birth have made at once so odious and so dear,',
'in the gray unpainted wood cabin, on the corner of a New Hampshire farm, or in the log-hut of the backwoods, or in the narrow lodging where he has endured the constraints and seeming of a city poverty,',
'will serve as well as any other condition as the symbol of a thought which pours itself indifferently through all.',
'I remember when in my younger days I had heard of the wonders of Italian painting, I fancied the great pictures would be great strangers;',
'some surprising combination of color and form;',
'a foreign wonder, barbaric pearl and gold, like the spontoons and standards of the militia, which play such pranks in the eyes and imaginations of school-boys.',
'I was to see and acquire I knew not what.',
'When I came at last to Rome and saw with eyes the pictures, I found that genius left to novices the gay and fantastic and ostentatious, and itself pierced directly to the simple and true;',
'that it was familiar and sincere;',
'that it was the old, eternal fact I had met already in so many forms,—unto which I lived;',
'that it was the plain you and me I knew so well,—had left at home in so many conversations.',
'I had the same experience already in a church at Naples.',
'There I saw that nothing was changed with me but the place, and said to myself—‘Thou foolish child, hast thou come out hither, over four thousand miles of salt water, to find that which was perfect to thee there at home?’',
'That fact I saw again in the Academmia at Naples, in the chambers of sculpture, and yet again when I came to Rome and to the paintings of Raphael, Angelo, Sacchi, Titian, and Leonardo da Vinci.',
'“What, old mole! workest thou in the earth so fast?”',
'It had travelled by my side; that which I fancied I had left in Boston was here in the Vatican, and again at Milan and at Paris, and made all travelling ridiculous as a treadmill.',
'I now require this of all pictures, that they domesticate me, not that they dazzle me.',
'Pictures must not be too picturesque.',
'Nothing astonishes men so much as common-sense and plain dealing.',
'All great actions have been simple, and all great pictures are.',
'The Transfiguration, by Raphael, is an eminent example of this peculiar merit.',
'A calm benignant beauty shines over all this picture, and goes directly to the heart.',
'It seems almost to call you by name.',
'The sweet and sublime face of Jesus is beyond praise, yet how it disappoints all florid expectations!',
'This familiar, simple, home-speaking countenance is as if one should meet a friend.',
'The knowledge of picture-dealers has its value, but listen not to their criticism when your heart is touched by genius.',
'It was not painted for them, it was painted for you; for such as had eyes capable of being touched by simplicity and lofty emotions.',
'Yet when we have said all our fine things about the arts, we must end with a frank confession, that the arts, as we know them, are but initial.',
'Our best praise is given to what they aimed and promised, not to the actual result.',
'He has conceived meanly of the resources of man, who believes that the best age of production is past.',
'The real value of the Iliad or the Transfiguration is as signs of power; billows or ripples they are of the stream of tendency; tokens of the everlasting effort to produce, which even in its worst estate the soul betrays.',
'Art has not yet come to its maturity if it do not put itself abreast with the most potent influences of the world,',
'if it is not practical and moral,',
'if it do not stand in connection with the conscience,',
'if it do not make the poor and uncultivated feel that it addresses them with a voice of lofty cheer.',
'There is higher work for Art than the arts.',
'They are abortive births of an imperfect or vitiated instinct.',
'Art is the need to create; but in its essence, immense and universal, it is impatient of working with lame or tied hands, and of making cripples and monsters, such as all pictures and statues are.',
'Nothing less than the creation of man and nature is its end.',
'A man should find in it an outlet for his whole energy.',
'He may paint and carve only as long as he can do that.',
'Art should exhilarate, and throw down the walls of circumstance on every side, awakening in the beholder the same sense of universal relation and power which the work evinced in the artist, and its highest effect is to make new artists.',
'Already History is old enough to witness the old age and disappearance of particular arts.',
'The art of sculpture is long ago perished to any real effect.',
'It was originally a useful art, a mode of writing, a savage’s record of gratitude or devotion, and among a people possessed of a wonderful perception of form this childish carving was refined to the utmost splendor of effect.',
'But it is the game of a rude and youthful people, and not the manly labor of a wise and spiritual nation.',
'Under an oak-tree loaded with leaves and nuts, under a sky full of eternal eyes, I stand in a thoroughfare; but in the works of our plastic arts and especially of sculpture, creation is driven into a corner.',
'I cannot hide from myself that there is a certain appearance of paltriness, as of toys and the trumpery of a theatre, in sculpture.',
'Nature transcends all our moods of thought, and its secret we do not yet find.',
'But the gallery stands at the mercy of our moods, and there is a moment when it becomes frivolous.',
'I do not wonder that Newton, with an attention habitually engaged on the paths of planets and suns, should have wondered what the Earl of Pembroke found to admire in “stone dolls.”',
'Sculpture may serve to teach the pupil how deep is the secret of form, how purely the spirit can translate its meanings into that eloquent dialect.',
'But the statue will look cold and false before that new activity which needs to roll through all things, and is impatient of counterfeits and things not alive.',
'Picture and sculpture are the celebrations and festivities of form.',
'But true art is never fixed, but always flowing.',
'The sweetest music is not in the oratorio, but in the human voice when it speaks from its instant life tones of tenderness, truth, or courage.',
'The oratorio has already lost its relation to the morning, to the sun, and the earth, but that persuading voice is in tune with these.',
'All works of art should not be detached, but extempore performances.',
'A great man is a new statue in every attitude and action.',
'A beautiful woman is a picture which drives all beholders nobly mad.',
'Life may be lyric or epic, as well as a poem or a romance.',
'A true announcement of the law of creation, if a man were found worthy to declare it, would carry art up into the kingdom of nature, and destroy its separate and contrasted existence.',
'The fountains of invention and beauty in modern society are all but dried up.',
'A popular novel, a theatre, or a ball-room makes us feel that we are all paupers in the alms-house of this world, without dignity, without skill or industry.',
'Art is as poor and low.',
'The old tragic Necessity, which lowers on the brows even of the Venuses and the Cupids of the antique, and furnishes the sole apology for the intrusion of such anomalous figures into nature,—namely, that they were inevitable;',
'that the artist was drunk with a passion for form which he could not resist, and which vented itself in these fine extravagances,—no longer dignifies the chisel or the pencil.',
'But the artist and the connoisseur now seek in art the exhibition of their talent, or an asylum from the evils of life.',
'Men are not well pleased with the figure they make in their own imaginations, and they flee to art, and convey their better sense in an oratorio, a statue, or a picture.',
'Art makes the same effort which a sensual prosperity makes; namely to detach the beautiful from the useful, to do up the work as unavoidable, and, hating it, pass on to enjoyment.',
'These solaces and compensations, this division of beauty from use, the laws of nature do not permit.',
'As soon as beauty is sought, not from religion and love but for pleasure, it degrades the seeker.',
'High beauty is no longer attainable by him in canvas or in stone, in sound, or in lyrical construction; an effeminate, prudent, sickly beauty, which is not beauty, is all that can be formed; for the hand can never execute any thing higher than the character can inspire.',
'The art that thus separates is itself first separated.',
'Art must not be a superficial talent, but must begin farther back in man.',
'Now men do not see nature to be beautiful, and they go to make a statue which shall be.',
'They abhor men as tasteless, dull, and inconvertible, and console themselves with color-bags and blocks of marble.',
'They reject life as prosaic, and create a death which they call poetic.',
'They despatch the day’s weary chores, and fly to voluptuous reveries.',
'They eat and drink, that they may afterwards execute the ideal.',
'Thus is art vilified; the name conveys to the mind its secondary and bad senses; it stands in the imagination as somewhat contrary to nature, and struck with death from the first.',
'Would it not be better to begin higher up,—to serve the ideal before they eat and drink; to serve the ideal in eating and drinking, in drawing the breath, and in the functions of life?',
'Beauty must come back to the useful arts, and the distinction between the fine and the useful arts be forgotten.',
'If history were truly told, if life were nobly spent, it would be no longer easy or possible to distinguish the one from the other.',
'In nature, all is useful, all is beautiful.',
'It is therefore beautiful because it is alive, moving, reproductive; it is therefore useful because it is symmetrical and fair.',
'Beauty will not come at the call of a legislature, nor will it repeat in England or America its history in Greece.',
'It will come, as always, unannounced, and spring up between the feet of brave and earnest men.',
'It is in vain that we look for genius to reiterate its miracles in the old arts; it is its instinct to find beauty and holiness in new and necessary facts, in the field and road-side, in the shop and mill.',
'Proceeding from a religious heart it will raise to a divine use the railroad, the insurance office, the joint-stock company;',
'our law, our primary assemblies, our commerce, the galvanic battery, the electric jar, the prism, and the chemist’s retort;',
'in which we seek now only an economical use.',
'Is not the selfish and even cruel aspect which belongs to our great mechanical works, to mills, railways, and machinery, the effect of the mercenary impulses which these works obey?',
'When its errands are noble and adequate, a steamboat bridging the Atlantic between Old and New England and arriving at its ports with the punctuality of a planet, is a step of man into harmony with nature.',
'The boat at St. Petersburg, which plies along the Lena by magnetism, needs little to make it sublime.',
'When science is learned in love, and its powers are wielded by love, they will appear the supplements and continuations of the material creation.',

'ESSAYS, SECOND SERIES',
'By RALPH WALDO EMERSON',
'I: THE POET.',
'A moody child and wildly wise',
'Pursued the game with joyful eyes,',
'Which chose, like meteors, their way,',
'And rived the dark with private ray:',
'They overleapt the horizon’s edge,',
'Searched with Apollo’s privilege;',
'Through man, and woman, and sea, and star',
'Saw the dance of nature forward far;',
'Through worlds, and races, and terms, and times',
'Saw musical order, and pairing rhymes.',
'Olympian bards who sung',
'Divine ideas below,',
'Which always find us young,',
'And always keep us so.',
'Those who are esteemed umpires of taste are often persons who have acquired some knowledge of admired pictures or sculptures, and have an inclination for whatever is elegant;',
'but if you inquire whether they are beautiful souls, and whether their own acts are like fair pictures, you learn that they are selfish and sensual.',
'Their cultivation is local, as if you should rub a log of dry wood in one spot to produce fire, all the rest remaining cold.',
'Their knowledge of the fine arts is some study of rules and particulars, or some limited judgment of color or form, which is exercised for amusement or for show.',
'It is a proof of the shallowness of the doctrine of beauty as it lies in the minds of our amateurs, that men seem to have lost the perception of the instant dependence of form upon soul.',
'There is no doctrine of forms in our philosophy.',
'We were put into our bodies, as fire is put into a pan to be carried about; but there is no accurate adjustment between the spirit and the organ, much less is the latter the germination of the former.',
'So in regard to other forms, the intellectual men do not believe in any essential dependence of the material world on thought and volition.',
'Theologians think it a pretty air-castle to talk of the Spiritual meaning of a ship or a cloud, of a city or a contract, but they prefer to come again to the solid ground of historical evidence;',
'and even the poets are contented with a civil and conformed manner of living, and to write poems from the fancy, at a safe distance from their own experience.',
'But the highest minds of the world have never ceased to explore the double meaning, or shall I say the quadruple or the centuple or much more manifold meaning, of every sensuous fact;',
'Orpheus, Empedocles, Heraclitus, Plato, Plutarch, Dante, Swedenborg, and the masters of sculpture, picture, and poetry.',
'For we are not pans and barrows, nor even porters of the fire and torch-bearers, but children of the fire, made of it, and only the same divinity transmuted and at two or three removes, when we know least about it.',
'And this hidden truth, that the fountains whence all this river of Time and its creatures floweth are intrinsically ideal and beautiful, draws us to the consideration of the nature and functions of the Poet, or the man of Beauty;',
'to the means and materials he uses, and to the general aspect of the art in the present time.',
'The breadth of the problem is great, for the poet is representative.',
'He stands among partial men for the complete man, and apprises us not of his wealth, but of the common wealth.',
'The young man reveres men of genius, because, to speak truly, they are more himself than he is.',
'They receive of the soul as he also receives, but they more.',
'Nature enhances her beauty, to the eye of loving men, from their belief that the poet is beholding her shows at the same time.',
'He is isolated among his contemporaries by truth and by his art, but with this consolation in his pursuits, that they will draw all men sooner or later.',
'For all men live by truth and stand in need of expression.',
'In love, in art, in avarice, in politics, in labor, in games, we study to utter our painful secret.',
'The man is only half himself, the other half is his expression.',
'Notwithstanding this necessity to be published, adequate expression is rare.',
'I know not how it is that we need an interpreter, but the great majority of men seem to be minors, who have not yet come into possession of their own, or mutes, who cannot report the conversation they have had with nature.',
'There is no man who does not anticipate a supersensual utility in the sun and stars, earth and water.',
'These stand and wait to render him a peculiar service.',
'But there is some obstruction or some excess of phlegm in our constitution, which does not suffer them to yield the due effect.',
'Too feeble fall the impressions of nature on us to make us artists.',
'Every touch should thrill.',
'Every man should be so much an artist that he could report in conversation what had befallen him.',
'Yet, in our experience, the rays or appulses have sufficient force to arrive at the senses, but not enough to reach the quick and compel the reproduction of themselves in speech.',
'The poet is the person in whom these powers are in balance, the man without impediment, who sees and handles that which others dream of, traverses the whole scale of experience, and is representative of man, in virtue of being the largest power to receive and to impart.',
'For the Universe has three children, born at one time, which reappear under different names in every system of thought, whether they be called cause, operation, and effect;',
'or, more poetically, Jove, Pluto, Neptune;',
'or, theologically, the Father, the Spirit, and the Son;',
'but which we will call here the Knower, the Doer, and the Sayer.',
'These stand respectively for the love of truth, for the love of good, and for the love of beauty.',
'These three are equal.',
'Each is that which he is essentially, so that he cannot be surmounted or analyzed, and each of these three has the power of the others latent in him, and his own, patent.',
'The poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents beauty.',
'He is a sovereign, and stands on the centre.',
'For the world is not painted or adorned, but is from the beginning beautiful; and God has not made some beautiful things, but Beauty is the creator of the universe.',
'Therefore the poet is not any permissive potentate, but is emperor in his own right.',
'Criticism is infested with a cant of materialism,',
'which assumes that manual skill and activity is the first merit of all men, and disparages such as say and do not,',
'overlooking the fact that some men, namely poets, are natural sayers, sent into the world to the end of expression, and confounds them with those whose province is action but who quit it to imitate the sayers.',
'But Homer’s words are as costly and admirable to Homer as Agamemnon’s victories are to Agamemnon.',
'The poet does not wait for the hero or the sage, but, as they act and think primarily, so he writes primarily what will and must be spoken, reckoning the others, though primaries also, yet, in respect to him, secondaries and servants;',
'as sitters or models in the studio of a painter, or as assistants who bring building materials to an architect.',
'For poetry was all written before time was, and whenever we are so finely organized that we can penetrate into that region where the air is music, we hear those primal warblings and attempt to write them down,',
'but we lose ever and anon a word or a verse and substitute something of our own, and thus miswrite the poem.',
'The men of more delicate ear write down these cadences more faithfully, and these transcripts, though imperfect, become the songs of the nations.',
'For nature is as truly beautiful as it is good, or as it is reasonable, and must as much appear as it must be done, or be known.',
'Words and deeds are quite indifferent modes of the divine energy.',
'Words are also actions, and actions are a kind of words.',
'The sign and credentials of the poet are that he announces that which no man foretold.',
'He is the true and only doctor; he knows and tells; he is the only teller of news, for he was present and privy to the appearance which he describes.',
'He is a beholder of ideas and an utterer of the necessary and causal.',
'For we do not speak now of men of poetical talents, or of industry and skill in metre, but of the true poet.',
'I took part in a conversation the other day concerning a recent writer of lyrics, a man of subtle mind, whose head appeared to be a music-box of delicate tunes and rhythms, and whose skill and command of language, we could not sufficiently praise.',
'But when the question arose whether he was not only a lyrist but a poet, we were obliged to confess that he is plainly a contemporary, not an eternal man.',
'He does not stand out of our low limitations, like a Chimborazo under the line, running up from the torrid Base through all the climates of the globe, with belts of the herbage of every latitude on its high and mottled sides;',
'but this genius is the landscape-garden of a modern house, adorned with fountains and statues, with well-bred men and women standing and sitting in the walks and terraces.',
'We hear, through all the varied music, the ground-tone of conventional life.',
'Our poets are men of talents who sing, and not the children of music.',
'The argument is secondary, the finish of the verses is primary.',
'For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument that makes a poem,—a thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal it has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature with a new thing.',
'The thought and the form are equal in the order of time, but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form.',
'The poet has a new thought; he has a whole new experience to unfold; he will tell us how it was with him, and all men will be the richer in his fortune.',
'For the experience of each new age requires a new confession, and the world seems always waiting for its poet.',
'I remember when I was young how much I was moved one morning by tidings that genius had appeared in a youth who sat near me at table.',
'He had left his work and gone rambling none knew whither, and had written hundreds of lines, but could not tell whether that which was in him was therein told; he could tell nothing but that all was changed,—man, beast, heaven, earth and sea.',
'How gladly we listened! how credulous!',
'Society seemed to be compromised.',
'We sat in the aurora of a sunrise which was to put out all the stars.',
'Boston seemed to be at twice the distance it had the night before, or was much farther than that.',
'Rome,—what was Rome?',
'Plutarch and Shakspeare were in the yellow leaf, and Homer no more should be heard of.',
'It is much to know that poetry has been written this very day, under this very roof, by your side.',
'What! that wonderful spirit has not expired!',
'These stony moments are still sparkling and animated!',
'I had fancied that the oracles were all silent, and nature had spent her fires; and behold! all night, from every pore, these fine auroras have been streaming.',
'Every one has some interest in the advent of the poet, and no one knows how much it may concern him.',
'We know that the secret of the world is profound, but who or what shall be our interpreter, we know not.',
'A mountain ramble, a new style of face, a new person, may put the key into our hands.',
'Of course the value of genius to us is in the veracity of its report.',
'Talent may frolic and juggle; genius realizes and adds.',
'Mankind in good earnest have availed so far in understanding themselves and their work, that the foremost watchman on the peak announces his news.',
'It is the truest word ever spoken, and the phrase will be the fittest, most musical, and the unerring voice of the world for that time.',
'All that we call sacred history attests that the birth of a poet is the principal event in chronology.',
'Man, never so often deceived, still watches for the arrival of a brother who can hold him steady to a truth until he has made it his own.',
'With what joy I begin to read a poem which I confide in as an inspiration!',
'And now my chains are to be broken; I shall mount above these clouds and opaque airs in which I live,—opaque, though they seem transparent,—and from the heaven of truth I shall see and comprehend my relations.',
'That will reconcile me to life and renovate nature, to see trifles animated by a tendency, and to know what I am doing.',
'Life will no more be a noise; now I shall see men and women, and know the signs by which they may be discerned from fools and satans.',
'This day shall be better than my birthday: then I became an animal; now I am invited into the science of the real.',
'Such is the hope, but the fruition is postponed.',
'Oftener it falls that this winged man, who will carry me into the heaven, whirls me into mists, then leaps and frisks about with me as it were from cloud to cloud, still affirming that he is bound heavenward;',
'and I, being myself a novice, am slow in perceiving that he does not know the way into the heavens, and is merely bent that I should admire his skill to rise like a fowl or a flying fish, a little way from the ground or the water;',
'but the all-piercing, all-feeding, and ocular air of heaven that man shall never inhabit.',
'I tumble down again soon into my old nooks, and lead the life of exaggerations as before, and have lost my faith in the possibility of any guide who can lead me thither where I would be.',
'But, leaving these victims of vanity, let us, with new hope, observe how nature, by worthier impulses, has ensured the poet’s fidelity to his office of announcement and affirming, namely by the beauty of things, which becomes a new and higher beauty when expressed.',
'Nature offers all her creatures to him as a picture-language.',
'Being used as a type, a second wonderful value appears in the object, far better than its old value; as the carpenter’s stretched cord, if you hold your ear close enough, is musical in the breeze.',
'“Things more excellent than every image,” says Jamblichus, “are expressed through images.”',
'Things admit of being used as symbols because nature is a symbol, in the whole, and in every part.',
'Every line we can draw in the sand has expression; and there is no body without its spirit or genius.',
'All form is an effect of character; all condition, of the quality of the life; all harmony, of health; and for this reason a perception of beauty should be sympathetic, or proper only to the good.',
'The beautiful rests on the foundations of the necessary.',
'The soul makes the body, as the wise Spenser teaches:—',
'“So every spirit, as it is most pure,',
'And hath in it the more of heavenly light,',
'So it the fairer body doth procure',
'To habit in, and it more fairly dight,',
'With cheerful grace and amiable sight.',
'For, of the soul, the body form doth take,',
'For soul is form, and doth the body make.”',
'Here we find ourselves suddenly not in a critical speculation but in a holy place, and should go very warily and reverently.',
'We stand before the secret of the world, there where Being passes into Appearance and Unity into Variety.',
'The Universe is the externization of the soul.',
'Wherever the life is, that bursts into appearance around it.',
'Our science is sensual, and therefore superficial.',
'The earth and the heavenly bodies, physics, and chemistry, we sensually treat, as if they were self-existent; but these are the retinue of that Being we have.',
'“The mighty heaven,” said Proclus, “exhibits, in its transfigurations, clear images of the splendor of intellectual perceptions; being moved in conjunction with the unapparent periods of intellectual natures.”',
'Therefore science always goes abreast with the just elevation of the man, keeping step with religion and metaphysics; or the state of science is an index of our self-knowledge.',
'Since everything in nature answers to a moral power, if any phenomenon remains brute and dark it is that the corresponding faculty in the observer is not yet active.',
'No wonder then, if these waters be so deep, that we hover over them with a religious regard.',
'The beauty of the fable proves the importance of the sense; to the poet, and to all others; or, if you please, every man is so far a poet as to be susceptible of these enchantments of nature; for all men have the thoughts whereof the universe is the celebration.',
'I find that the fascination resides in the symbol.',
'Who loves nature?',
'Who does not?',
'Is it only poets, and men of leisure and cultivation, who live with her?',
'No; but also hunters, farmers, grooms, and butchers, though they express their affection in their choice of life and not in their choice of words.',
'The writer wonders what the coachman or the hunter values in riding, in horses and dogs.',
'It is not superficial qualities.',
'When you talk with him he holds these at as slight a rate as you.',
'His worship is sympathetic; he has no definitions, but he is commanded in nature, by the living power which he feels to be there present.',
'No imitation or playing of these things would content him; he loves the earnest of the north wind, of rain, of stone, and wood, and iron.',
'A beauty not explicable is dearer than a beauty which we can see to the end of.',
'It is nature the symbol, nature certifying the supernatural, body overflowed by life which he worships with coarse but sincere rites.',
'The inwardness and mystery of this attachment drives men of every class to the use of emblems.',
'The schools of poets and philosophers are not more intoxicated with their symbols than the populace with theirs.',
'In our political parties, compute the power of badges and emblems.',
'See the great ball which they roll from Baltimore to Bunker hill!',
'In the political processions, Lowell goes in a loom, and Lynn in a shoe, and Salem in a ship.',
'Witness the cider-barrel, the log-cabin, the hickory-stick, the palmetto, and all the cognizances of party.',
'See the power of national emblems.',
'Some stars, lilies, leopards, a crescent, a lion, an eagle, or other figure which came into credit God knows how, on an old rag of bunting, blowing in the wind on a fort at the ends of the earth, shall make the blood tingle under the rudest or the most conventional exterior.',
'The people fancy they hate poetry, and they are all poets and mystics!',
'Beyond this universality of the symbolic language, we are apprised of the divineness of this superior use of things, whereby the world is a temple whose walls are covered with emblems, pictures, and commandments of the Deity,—',
'in this, that there is no fact in nature which does not carry the whole sense of nature;',
'and the distinctions which we make in events and in affairs, of low and high, honest and base, disappear when nature is used as a symbol.',
'Thought makes everything fit for use.',
'The vocabulary of an omniscient man would embrace words and images excluded from polite conversation.',
'What would be base, or even obscene, to the obscene, becomes illustrious, spoken in a new connexion of thought.',
'The piety of the Hebrew prophets purges their grossness.',
'The circumcision is an example of the power of poetry to raise the low and offensive.',
'Small and mean things serve as well as great symbols.',
'The meaner the type by which a law is expressed, the more pungent it is, and the more lasting in the memories of men: just as we choose the smallest box or case in which any needful utensil can be carried.',
'Bare lists of words are found suggestive to an imaginative and excited mind; as it is related of Lord Chatham that he was accustomed to read in Bailey’s Dictionary when he was preparing to speak in Parliament.',
'The poorest experience is rich enough for all the purposes of expressing thought.',
'Why covet a knowledge of new facts?',
'Day and night, house and garden, a few books, a few actions, serve us as well as would all trades and all spectacles.',
'We are far from having exhausted the significance of the few symbols we use.',
'We can come to use them yet with a terrible simplicity.',
'It does not need that a poem should be long.',
'Every word was once a poem.',
'Every new relation is a new word.',
'Also we use defects and deformities to a sacred purpose, so expressing our sense that the evils of the world are such only to the evil eye.',
'In the old mythology, mythologists observe, defects are ascribed to divine natures, as lameness to Vulcan, blindness to Cupid, and the like,—to signify exuberances.',
'For as it is dislocation and detachment from the life of God that makes things ugly, the poet, who re-attaches things to nature and the Whole,—',
're-attaching even artificial things and violations of nature, to nature, by a deeper insight,—',
'disposes very easily of the most disagreeable facts.',
'Readers of poetry see the factory-village and the railway, and fancy that the poetry of the landscape is broken up by these;',
'for these works of art are not yet consecrated in their reading;',
'but the poet sees them fall within the great Order not less than the beehive or the spider’s geometrical web.',
'Nature adopts them very fast into her vital circles, and the gliding train of cars she loves like her own.',
'Besides, in a centred mind, it signifies nothing how many mechanical inventions you exhibit.',
'Though you add millions, and never so surprising, the fact of mechanics has not gained a grain’s weight.',
'The spiritual fact remains unalterable, by many or by few particulars; as no mountain is of any appreciable height to break the curve of the sphere.',
'A shrewd country-boy goes to the city for the first time, and the complacent citizen is not satisfied with his little wonder.',
'It is not that he does not see all the fine houses and know that he never saw such before, but he disposes of them as easily as the poet finds place for the railway.',
'The chief value of the new fact is to enhance the great and constant fact of Life, which can dwarf any and every circumstance, and to which the belt of wampum and the commerce of America are alike.',
'The world being thus put under the mind for verb and noun, the poet is he who can articulate it.',
'For though life is great, and fascinates, and absorbs; and though all men are intelligent of the symbols through which it is named; yet they cannot originally use them.',
'We are symbols and inhabit symbols; workmen, work, and tools, words and things, birth and death, all are emblems; but we sympathize with the symbols, and being infatuated with the economical uses of things, we do not know that they are thoughts.',
'The poet, by an ulterior intellectual perception, gives them a power which makes their old use forgotten, and puts eyes and a tongue into every dumb and inanimate object.',
'He perceives the independence of the thought on the symbol, the stability of the thought, the accidency and fugacity of the symbol.',
'As the eyes of Lyncaeus were said to see through the earth, so the poet turns the world to glass, and shows us all things in their right series and procession.',
'For through that better perception he stands one step nearer to things, and sees the flowing or metamorphosis;',
'perceives that thought is multiform;',
'that within the form of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend into a higher form;',
'and following with his eyes the life, uses the forms which express that life, and so his speech flows with the flowing of nature.',
'All the facts of the animal economy, sex, nutriment, gestation, birth, growth, are symbols of the passage of the world into the soul of man, to suffer there a change and reappear a new and higher fact.',
'He uses forms according to the life, and not according to the form.',
'This is true science.',
'The poet alone knows astronomy, chemistry, vegetation and animation, for he does not stop at these facts, but employs them as signs.',
'He knows why the plain or meadow of space was strewn with these flowers we call suns and moons and stars; why the great deep is adorned with animals, with men, and gods; for in every word he speaks he rides on them as the horses of thought.',
'By virtue of this science the poet is the Namer or Language-maker, naming things sometimes after their appearance, sometimes after their essence, and giving to every one its own name and not another’s, thereby rejoicing the intellect, which delights in detachment or boundary.',
'The poets made all the words, and therefore language is the archives of history, and, if we must say it, a sort of tomb of the muses.',
'For though the origin of most of our words is forgotten, each word was at first a stroke of genius, and obtained currency because for the moment it symbolized the world to the first speaker and to the hearer.',
'The etymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant picture.',
'Language is fossil poetry.',
'As the limestone of the continent consists of infinite masses of the shells of animalcules, so language is made up of images or tropes, which now, in their secondary use, have long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin.',
'But the poet names the thing because he sees it, or comes one step nearer to it than any other.',
'This expression or naming is not art, but a second nature, grown out of the first, as a leaf out of a tree.',
'What we call nature is a certain self-regulated motion or change; and nature does all things by her own hands, and does not leave another to baptize her but baptizes herself; and this through the metamorphosis again.',
'I remember that a certain poet described it to me thus:',
'Genius is the activity which repairs the decays of things, whether wholly or partly of a material and finite kind.',
'Nature, through all her kingdoms, insures herself.',
'Nobody cares for planting the poor fungus; so she shakes down from the gills of one agaric countless spores, any one of which, being preserved, transmits new billions of spores to-morrow or next day.',
'The new agaric of this hour has a chance which the old one had not.',
'This atom of seed is thrown into a new place, not subject to the accidents which destroyed its parent two rods off.',
'She makes a man; and having brought him to ripe age, she will no longer run the risk of losing this wonder at a blow, but she detaches from him a new self, that the kind may be safe from accidents to which the individual is exposed.',
'So when the soul of the poet has come to ripeness of thought, she detaches and sends away from it its poems or songs,—a fearless, sleepless, deathless progeny, which is not exposed to the accidents of the weary kingdom of time;',
'a fearless, vivacious offspring, clad with wings (such was the virtue of the soul out of which they came) which carry them fast and far, and infix them irrecoverably into the hearts of men.',
'These wings are the beauty of the poet’s soul.',
'The songs, thus flying immortal from their mortal parent, are pursued by clamorous flights of censures, which swarm in far greater numbers and threaten to devour them; but these last are not winged.',
'At the end of a very short leap they fall plump down and rot, having received from the souls out of which they came no beautiful wings.',
'But the melodies of the poet ascend and leap and pierce into the deeps of infinite time.',
'So far the bard taught me, using his freer speech.',
'But nature has a higher end, in the production of New individuals, than security, namely ascension, or the passage of the soul into higher forms.',
'I knew in my younger days the sculptor who made the statue of the youth which stands in the public garden.',
'He was, as I remember, unable to tell directly, what made him happy or unhappy, but by wonderful indirections he could tell.',
'He rose one day, according to his habit, before the dawn, and saw the morning break, grand as the eternity out of which it came, and for many days after,',
'he strove to express this tranquillity, and lo! his chisel had fashioned out of marble the form of a beautiful youth, Phosphorus, whose aspect is such that it is said all persons who look on it become silent.',
'The poet also resigns himself to his mood, and that thought which agitated him is expressed, but alter idem, in a manner totally new.',
'The expression is organic, or the new type which things themselves take when liberated.',
'As, in the sun, objects paint their images on the retina of the eye, so they, sharing the aspiration of the whole universe, tend to paint a far more delicate copy of their essence in his mind.',
'Like the metamorphosis of things into higher organic forms is their change into melodies.',
'Over everything stands its daemon or soul, and, as the form of the thing is reflected by the eye, so the soul of the thing is reflected by a melody.',
'The sea, the mountain-ridge, Niagara, and every flower-bed, pre-exist, or super-exist, in pre-cantations,',
'which sail like odors in the air, and when any man goes by with an ear sufficiently fine, he overhears them and endeavors to write down the notes without diluting or depraving them.',
'And herein is the legitimation of criticism, in the mind’s faith that the poems are a corrupt version of some text in nature with which they ought to be made to tally.',
'A rhyme in one of our sonnets should not be less pleasing than the iterated nodes of a sea-shell, or the resembling difference of a group of flowers.',
'The pairing of the birds is an idyl, not tedious as our idyls are; a tempest is a rough ode, without falsehood or rant; a summer, with its harvest sown, reaped, and stored, is an epic song, subordinating how many admirably executed parts.',
'Why should not the symmetry and truth that modulate these, glide into our spirits, and we participate the invention of nature?',
'This insight, which expresses itself by what is called Imagination, is a very high sort of seeing, which does not come by study, but by the intellect being where and what it sees; by sharing the path or circuit of things through forms, and so making them translucid to others.',
'The path of things is silent.',
'Will they suffer a speaker to go with them?',
'A spy they will not suffer; a lover, a poet, is the transcendency of their own nature,—him they will suffer.',
'The condition of true naming, on the poet’s part, is his resigning himself to the divine aura which breathes through forms, and accompanying that.',
'It is a secret which every intellectual man quickly learns, that, beyond the energy of his possessed and conscious intellect he is capable of a new energy (as of an intellect doubled on itself), by abandonment to the nature of things;',
'that beside his privacy of power as an individual man, there is a great public power on which he can draw, by unlocking, at all risks, his human doors, and suffering the ethereal tides to roll and circulate through him;',
'then he is caught up into the life of the Universe, his speech is thunder, his thought is law, and his words are universally intelligible as the plants and animals.',
'The poet knows that he speaks adequately then only when he speaks somewhat wildly, or, “with the flower of the mind;” not with the intellect used as an organ, but with the intellect released from all service and suffered to take its direction from its celestial life;',
'or as the ancients were wont to express themselves, not with intellect alone but with the intellect inebriated by nectar.',
'As the traveller who has lost his way throws his reins on his horse’s neck and trusts to the instinct of the animal to find his road, so must we do with the divine animal who carries us through this world.',
'For if in any manner we can stimulate this instinct, new passages are opened for us into nature; the mind flows into and through things hardest and highest, and the metamorphosis is possible.',
'This is the reason why bards love wine, mead, narcotics, coffee, tea, opium, the fumes of sandal-wood and tobacco, or whatever other procurers of animal exhilaration.',
'All men avail themselves of such means as they can, to add this extraordinary power to their normal powers;',
'and to this end they prize conversation, music, pictures, sculpture, dancing, theatres, travelling, war, mobs, fires, gaming, politics, or love, or science, or animal intoxication,—which are several coarser or finer quasi-mechanical substitutes for the true nectar,',
'which is the ravishment of the intellect by coming nearer to the fact.',
'These are auxiliaries to the centrifugal tendency of a man, to his passage out into free space, and they help him to escape the custody of that body in which he is pent up, and of that jail-yard of individual relations in which he is enclosed.',
'Hence a great number of such as were professionally expressers of Beauty, as painters, poets, musicians, and actors, have been more than others wont to lead a life of pleasure and indulgence;',
'all but the few who received the true nectar;',
'and, as it was a spurious mode of attaining freedom, as it was an emancipation not into the heavens but into the freedom of baser places, they were punished for that advantage they won, by a dissipation and deterioration.',
'But never can any advantage be taken of nature by a trick.',
'The spirit of the world, the great calm presence of the Creator, comes not forth to the sorceries of opium or of wine.',
'The sublime vision comes to the pure and simple soul in a clean and chaste body.',
'That is not an inspiration, which we owe to narcotics, but some counterfeit excitement and fury.',
'Milton says that the lyric poet may drink wine and live generously, but the epic poet, he who shall sing of the gods and their descent unto men, must drink water out of a wooden bowl.',
'For poetry is not ‘Devil’s wine,’ but God’s wine.',
'It is with this as it is with toys.',
'We fill the hands and nurseries of our children with all manner of dolls, drums, and horses; withdrawing their eyes from the plain face and sufficing objects of nature, the sun, and moon, the animals, the water, and stones, which should be their toys.',
'So the poet’s habit of living should be set on a key so low that the common influences should delight him.',
'His cheerfulness should be the gift of the sunlight; the air should suffice for his inspiration, and he should be tipsy with water.',
'That spirit which suffices quiet hearts, which seems to come forth to such from every dry knoll of sere grass, from every pine-stump and half-imbedded stone on which the dull March sun shines, comes forth to the poor and hungry, and such as are of simple taste.',
'If thou fill thy brain with Boston and New York, with fashion and covetousness, and wilt stimulate thy jaded senses with wine and French coffee, thou shalt find no radiance of wisdom in the lonely waste of the pinewoods.',
'If the imagination intoxicates the poet, it is not inactive in other men.',
'The metamorphosis excites in the beholder an emotion of joy.',
'The use of symbols has a certain power of emancipation and exhilaration for all men.',
'We seem to be touched by a wand which makes us dance and run about happily, like children.',
'We are like persons who come out of a cave or cellar into the open air.',
'This is the effect on us of tropes, fables, oracles, and all poetic forms.',
'Poets are thus liberating gods.',
'Men have really got a new sense, and found within their world another world, or nest of worlds; for, the metamorphosis once seen, we divine that it does not stop.',
'I will not now consider how much this makes the charm of algebra and the mathematics, which also have their tropes, but it is felt in every definition;',
'as when Aristotle defines space to be an immovable vessel in which things are contained;—or when Plato defines a line to be a flowing point;',
'or figure to be a bound of solid;',
'and many the like.',
'What a joyful sense of freedom we have when Vitruvius announces the old opinion of artists that no architect can build any house well who does not know something of anatomy.',
'When Socrates, in Charmides, tells us that the soul is cured of its maladies by certain incantations, and that these incantations are beautiful reasons, from which temperance is generated in souls;',
'when Plato calls the world an animal;',
'and Timaeus affirms that the plants also are animals;',
'or affirms a man to be a heavenly tree, growing with his root, which is his head, upward;',
'and, as George Chapman, following him, writes,—',
'“So in our tree of man, whose nervie root',
'Springs in his top;”—',
'when Orpheus speaks of hoariness as “that white flower which marks extreme old age;” when Proclus calls the universe the statue of the intellect;',
'when Chaucer, in his praise of ‘Gentilesse,’ compares good blood in mean condition to fire, which, though carried to the darkest house betwixt this and the mount of Caucasus, will yet hold its natural office and burn as bright as if twenty thousand men did it behold;',
'when John saw, in the Apocalypse, the ruin of the world through evil, and the stars fall from heaven as the figtree casteth her untimely fruit;',
'when Aesop reports the whole catalogue of common daily relations through the masquerade of birds and beasts;—we take the cheerful hint of the immortality of our essence and its versatile habit and escapes, as when the gypsies say “it is in vain to hang them, they cannot die.”',
'The poets are thus liberating gods.',
'The ancient British bards had for the title of their order, “Those Who are free throughout the world.”',
'They are free, and they make free.',
'An imaginative book renders us much more service at first, by stimulating us through its tropes, than afterward when we arrive at the precise sense of the author.',
'I think nothing is of any value in books excepting the transcendental and extraordinary.',
'If a man is inflamed and carried away by his thought, to that degree that he forgets the authors and the public and heeds only this one dream which holds him like an insanity, let me read his paper, and you may have all the arguments and histories and criticism.',
'All the value which attaches to Pythagoras, Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa, Cardan, Kepler, Swedenborg, Schelling, Oken, or any other who introduces questionable facts into his cosmogony,',
'as angels, devils, magic,',
'astrology, palmistry, mesmerism, and so on, is the certificate we have of departure from routine, and that here is a new witness.',
'That also is the best success in conversation, the magic of liberty, which puts the world like a ball in our hands.',
'How cheap even the liberty then seems;',
'how mean to study, when an emotion communicates to the intellect the power to sap and upheave nature;',
'how great the perspective! nations, times, systems, enter and disappear like threads in tapestry of large figure and many colors;',
'dream delivers us to dream, and while the drunkenness lasts we will sell our bed, our philosophy, our religion, in our opulence.',
'There is good reason why we should prize this liberation.',
'The fate of the poor shepherd, who, blinded and lost in the snow-storm, perishes in a drift within a few feet of his cottage door, is an emblem of the state of man.',
'On the brink of the waters of life and truth, we are miserably dying.',
'The inaccessibleness of every thought but that we are in, is wonderful.',
'What if you come near to it; you are as remote when you are nearest as when you are farthest.',
'Every thought is also a prison; every heaven is also a prison.',
'Therefore we love the poet, the inventor, who in any form, whether in an ode or in an action or in looks and behavior has yielded us a new thought.',
'He unlocks our chains and admits us to a new scene.',
'This emancipation is dear to all men, and the power to impart it, as it must come from greater depth and scope of thought, is a measure of intellect.',
'Therefore all books of the imagination endure, all which ascend to that truth that the writer sees nature beneath him, and uses it as his exponent.',
'Every verse or sentence possessing this virtue will take care of its own immortality.',
'The religions of the world are the ejaculations of a few imaginative men.',
'But the quality of the imagination is to flow, and not to freeze.',
'The poet did not stop at the color or the form, but read their meaning; neither may he rest in this meaning, but he makes the same objects exponents of his new thought.',
'Here is the difference betwixt the poet and the mystic, that the last nails a symbol to one sense, which was a true sense for a moment, but soon becomes old and false.',
'For all symbols are fluxional; all language is vehicular and transitive, and is good, as ferries and horses are, for conveyance, not as farms and houses are, for homestead.',
'Mysticism consists in the mistake of an accidental and individual symbol for an universal one.',
'The morning-redness happens to be the favorite meteor to the eyes of Jacob Behmen, and comes to stand to him for truth and faith; and, he believes, should stand for the same realities to every reader.',
'But the first reader prefers as naturally the symbol of a mother and child, or a gardener and his bulb, or a jeweller polishing a gem.',
'Either of these, or of a myriad more, are equally good to the person to whom they are significant.',
'Only they must be held lightly, and be very willingly translated into the equivalent terms which others use.',
'And the mystic must be steadily told,—All that you say is just as true without the tedious use of that symbol as with it.',
'Let us have a little algebra, instead of this trite rhetoric,—universal signs, instead of these village symbols,—and we shall both be gainers.',
'The history of hierarchies seems to show that all religious error consisted in making the symbol too stark and solid, and was at last nothing but an excess of the organ of language.',
'Swedenborg, of all men in the recent ages, stands eminently for the translator of nature into thought.',
'I do not know the man in history to whom things stood so uniformly for words.',
'Before him the metamorphosis continually plays.',
'Everything on which his eye rests, obeys the impulses of moral nature.',
'The figs become grapes whilst he eats them.',
'When some of his angels affirmed a truth, the laurel twig which they held blossomed in their hands.',
'The noise which at a distance appeared like gnashing and thumping, on coming nearer was found to be the voice of disputants.',
'The men in one of his visions, seen in heavenly light, appeared like dragons, and seemed in darkness;',
'but to each other they appeared as men, and when the light from heaven shone into their cabin, they complained of the darkness, and were compelled to shut the window that they might see.',
'There was this perception in him which makes the poet or seer an object of awe and terror, namely that the same man or society of men may wear one aspect to themselves and their companions, and a different aspect to higher intelligences.',
'Certain priests, whom he describes as conversing very learnedly together, appeared to the children who were at some distance, like dead horses; and many the like misappearances.',
'And instantly the mind inquires whether these fishes under the bridge, yonder oxen in the pasture, those dogs in the yard, are immutably fishes, oxen, and dogs, or only so appear to me, and perchance to themselves appear upright men; and whether I appear as a man to all eyes.',
'The Bramins and Pythagoras propounded the same question, and if any poet has witnessed the transformation he doubtless found it in harmony with various experiences.',
'We have all seen changes as considerable in wheat and caterpillars.',
'He is the poet and shall draw us with love and terror, who sees through the flowing vest the firm nature, and can declare it.',
'I look in vain for the poet whom I describe.',
'We do not with sufficient plainness or sufficient profoundness address ourselves to life, nor dare we chaunt our own times and social circumstance.',
'If we filled the day with bravery, we should not shrink from celebrating it.',
'Time and nature yield us many gifts, but not yet the timely man, the new religion, the reconciler, whom all things await.',
'Dante’s praise is that he dared to write his autobiography in colossal cipher, or into universality.',
'We have yet had no genius in America, with tyrannous eye, which knew the value of our incomparable materials, and saw, in the barbarism and materialism of the times, another carnival of the same gods whose picture he so much admires in Homer;',
'then in the Middle Age;',
'then in Calvinism.',
'Banks and tariffs, the newspaper and caucus, Methodism and Unitarianism, are flat and dull to dull people, but rest on the same foundations of wonder as the town of Troy and the temple of Delphi, and are as swiftly passing away.',
'Our logrolling, our stumps and their politics, our fisheries, our Negroes and Indians, our boats and our repudiations, the wrath of rogues and the pusillanimity of honest men, the northern trade, the southern planting, the western clearing, Oregon and Texas, are yet unsung.',
'Yet America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres.',
'If I have not found that excellent combination of gifts in my countrymen which I seek, neither could I aid myself to fix the idea of the poet by reading now and then in Chalmers’s collection of five centuries of English poets.',
'These are wits more than poets, though there have been poets among them.',
'But when we adhere to the ideal of the poet, we have our difficulties even with Milton and Homer.',
'Milton is too literary, and Homer too literal and historical.',
'But I am not wise enough for a national criticism, and must use the old largeness a little longer, to discharge my errand from the muse to the poet concerning his art.',
'Art is the path of the creator to his work.',
'The paths or methods are ideal and eternal, though few men ever see them; not the artist himself for years, or for a lifetime, unless he come into the conditions.',
'The painter, the sculptor, the composer, the epic rhapsodist, the orator, all partake one desire, namely to express themselves symmetrically and abundantly, not dwarfishly and fragmentarily.',
'They found or put themselves in certain conditions, as, the painter and sculptor before some impressive human figures; the orator, into the assembly of the people; and the others in such scenes as each has found exciting to his intellect; and each presently feels the new desire.',
'He hears a voice, he sees a beckoning.',
'Then he is apprised, with wonder, what herds of daemons hem him in.',
'He can no more rest; he says, with the old painter, “By God, it is in me and must go forth of me.”',
'He pursues a beauty, half seen, which flies before him.',
'The poet pours out verses in every solitude.',
'Most of the things he says are conventional, no doubt; but by and by he says something which is original and beautiful.',
'That charms him.',
'He would say nothing else but such things.',
'In our way of talking we say ‘That is yours, this is mine;’ but the poet knows well that it is not his; that it is as strange and beautiful to him as to you; he would fain hear the like eloquence at length.',
'Once having tasted this immortal ichor, he cannot have enough of it, and as an admirable creative power exists in these intellections, it is of the last importance that these things get spoken.',
'What a little of all we know is said!',
'What drops of all the sea of our science are baled up! and by what accident it is that these are exposed, when so many secrets sleep in nature!',
'Hence the necessity of speech and song; hence these throbs and heart-beatings in the orator, at the door of the assembly, to the end namely that thought may be ejaculated as Logos, or Word.',
'Doubt not, O poet, but persist.',
'Say ‘It is in me, and shall out.’',
'Stand there, balked and dumb, stuttering and stammering, hissed and hooted, stand and strive, until at last rage draw out of thee that dream-power which every night shows thee is thine own;',
'a power transcending all limit and privacy, and by virtue of which a man is the conductor of the whole river of electricity.',
'Nothing walks, or creeps, or grows, or exists, which must not in turn arise and walk before him as exponent of his meaning.',
'Comes he to that power, his genius is no longer exhaustible.',
'All the creatures by pairs and by tribes pour into his mind as into a Noah’s ark, to come forth again to people a new world.',
'This is like the stock of air for our respiration or for the combustion of our fireplace; not a measure of gallons, but the entire atmosphere if wanted.',
'And therefore the rich poets, as Homer, Chaucer, Shakspeare, and Raphael, have obviously no limits to their works except the limits of their lifetime, and resemble a mirror carried through the street, ready to render an image of every created thing.',
'O poet! a new nobility is conferred in groves and pastures, and not in castles or by the sword-blade any longer.',
'The conditions are hard, but equal.',
'Thou shalt leave the world, and know the muse only.',
'Thou shalt not know any longer the times, customs, graces, politics, or opinions of men, but shalt take all from the muse.',
'For the time of towns is tolled from the world by funereal chimes, but in nature the universal hours are counted by succeeding tribes of animals and plants, and by growth of joy on joy.',
'God wills also that thou abdicate a manifold and duplex life, and that thou be content that others speak for thee.',
'Others shall be thy gentlemen and shall represent all courtesy and worldly life for thee; others shall do the great and resounding actions also.',
'Thou shalt lie close hid with nature, and canst not be afforded to the Capitol or the Exchange.',
'The world is full of renunciations and apprenticeships, and this is thine: thou must pass for a fool and a churl for a long season.',
'This is the screen and sheath in which Pan has protected his well-beloved flower, and thou shalt be known only to thine own, and they shall console thee with tenderest love.',
'And thou shalt not be able to rehearse the names of thy friends in thy verse, for an old shame before the holy ideal.',
'And this is the reward; that the ideal shall be real to thee, and the impressions of the actual world shall fall like summer rain, copious, but not troublesome, to thy invulnerable essence.',
'Thou shalt have the whole land for thy park and manor, the sea for thy bath and navigation, without tax and without envy; the woods and the rivers thou shalt own; and thou shalt possess that wherein others are only tenants and boarders.',
'Thou true land-lord! sea-lord! air-lord!',
'Wherever snow falls or water flows or birds fly,',
'wherever day and night meet in twilight,',
'wherever the blue heaven is hung by clouds or sown with stars,',
'wherever are forms with transparent boundaries,',
'wherever are outlets into celestial space,',
'wherever is danger, and awe, and love,—',
'there is Beauty, plenteous as rain, shed for thee, and though thou shouldest walk the world over, thou shalt not be able to find a condition inopportune or ignoble.',
'II: EXPERIENCE.',
'THE lords of life, the lords of life,—',
'I saw them pass,',
'In their own guise,',
'Like and unlike,',
'Portly and grim,',
'Use and Surprise,',
'Surface and Dream,',
'Succession swift, and spectral Wrong,',
'Temperament without a tongue,',
'And the inventor of the game',
'Omnipresent without name;—',
'Some to see, some to be guessed,',
'They marched from east to west:',
'Little man, least of all,',
'Among the legs of his guardians tall,',
'Walked about with puzzled look:—',
'Him by the hand dear Nature took;',
'Dearest Nature, strong and kind,',
'Whispered, ‘Darling, never mind!',
'Tomorrow they will wear another face,',
'The founder thou! these are thy race!’',
'WHERE do we find ourselves?',
'In a series of which we do not know the extremes, and believe that it has none.',
'We wake and find ourselves on a stair; there are stairs below us, which we seem to have ascended; there are stairs above us, many a one, which go upward and out of sight.',
'But the Genius which according to the old belief stands at the door by which we enter, and gives us the lethe to drink, that we may tell no tales, mixed the cup too strongly, and we cannot shake off the lethargy now at noonday.',
'Sleep lingers all our lifetime about our eyes, as night hovers all day in the boughs of the fir-tree.',
'All things swim and glitter.',
'Our life is not so much threatened as our perception.',
'Ghostlike we glide through nature, and should not know our place again.',
'Did our birth fall in some fit of indigence and frugality in nature, that she was so sparing of her fire and so liberal of her earth that it appears to us that we lack the affirmative principle, and though we have health and reason,',
'yet we have no superfluity of spirit for new creation?',
'We have enough to live and bring the year about, but not an ounce to impart or to invest.',
'Ah that our Genius were a little more of a genius!',
'We are like millers on the lower levels of a stream, when the factories above them have exhausted the water.',
'We too fancy that the upper people must have raised their dams.',
'If any of us knew what we were doing, or where we are going, then when we think we best know!',
'We do not know to-day whether we are busy or idle.',
'In times when we thought ourselves indolent, we have afterwards discovered that much was accomplished, and much was begun in us.',
'All our days are so unprofitable while they pass, that ‘tis wonderful where or when we ever got anything of this which we call wisdom, poetry, virtue.',
'We never got it on any dated calendar day.',
'Some heavenly days must have been intercalated somewhere, like those that Hermes won with dice of the Moon, that Osiris might be born.',
'It is said all martyrdoms looked mean when they were suffered.',
'Every ship is a romantic object, except that we sail in.',
'Embark, and the romance quits our vessel and hangs on every other sail in the horizon.',
'Our life looks trivial, and we shun to record it.',
'Men seem to have learned of the horizon the art of perpetual retreating and reference.',
'‘Yonder uplands are rich pasturage, and my neighbor has fertile meadow, but my field,’ says the querulous farmer, ‘only holds the world together.’',
'I quote another man’s saying; unluckily that other withdraws himself in the same way, and quotes me.',
'‘Tis the trick of nature thus to degrade to-day; a good deal of buzz, and somewhere a result slipped magically in.',
'Every roof is agreeable to the eye until it is lifted; then we find tragedy and moaning women and hard-eyed husbands and deluges of lethe, and the men ask, ‘What’s the news?’ as if the old were so bad.',
'How many individuals can we count in society? how many actions? how many opinions?',
'So much of our time is preparation, so much is routine, and so much retrospect, that the pith of each man’s genius contracts itself to a very few hours.',
'The history of literature—take the net result of Tiraboschi, Warton, or Schlegel,—is a sum of very few ideas and of very few original tales; all the rest being variation of these.',
'So in this great society wide lying around us, a critical analysis would find very few spontaneous actions.',
'It is almost all custom and gross sense.',
'There are even few opinions, and these seem organic in the speakers, and do not disturb the universal necessity.',
'What opium is instilled into all disaster!',
'It shows formidable as we approach it, but there is at last no rough rasping friction, but the most slippery sliding surfaces.',
'We fall soft on a thought; Ate Dea is gentle,—',
'“Over men’s heads walking aloft,',
'With tender feet treading so soft.”',
'People grieve and bemoan themselves, but it is not half so bad with them as they say.',
'There are moods in which we court suffering, in the hope that here at least we shall find reality, sharp peaks and edges of truth.',
'But it turns out to be scene-painting and counterfeit.',
'The only thing grief has taught me is to know how shallow it is.',
'That, like all the rest, plays about the surface, and never introduces me into the reality, for contact with which we would even pay the costly price of sons and lovers.',
'Was it Boscovich who found out that bodies never come in contact?',
'Well, souls never touch their objects.',
'An innavigable sea washes with silent waves between us and the things we aim at and converse with.',

'I cannot get it nearer to me.',
'If to-morrow I should be informed of the bankruptcy of my principal debtors, the loss of my property would be a great inconvenience to me, perhaps, for many years; but it would leave me as it found me,—neither better nor worse.',
'So is it with this calamity: it does not touch me; something which I fancied was a part of me, which could not be torn away without tearing me nor enlarged without enriching me, falls off from me and leaves no scar.',
'It was caducous.',
'I grieve that grief can teach me nothing, nor carry me one step into real nature.',
'The Indian who was laid under a curse that the wind should not blow on him, nor water flow to him, nor fire burn him, is a type of us all.',

'Nothing is left us now but death.',
'We look to that with a grim satisfaction, saying There at least is reality that will not dodge us.',
'I take this evanescence and lubricity of all objects, which lets them slip through our fingers then when we clutch hardest, to be the most unhandsome part of our condition.',
'Nature does not like to be observed, and likes that we should be her fools and playmates.',
'We may have the sphere for our cricket-ball, but not a berry for our philosophy.',
'Direct strokes she never gave us power to make; all our blows glance, all our hits are accidents.',
'Our relations to each other are oblique and casual.',
'Dream delivers us to dream, and there is no end to illusion.',
'Life is a train of moods like a string of beads, and as we pass through them they prove to be many-colored lenses which paint the world their own hue, and each shows only what lies in its focus.',
'From the mountain you see the mountain.',
'We animate what we can, and we see only what we animate.',
'Nature and books belong to the eyes that see them.',
'It depends on the mood of the man whether he shall see the sunset or the fine poem.',
'There are always sunsets, and there is always genius; but only a few hours so serene that we can relish nature or criticism.',
'The more or less depends on structure or temperament.',
'Temperament is the iron wire on which the beads are strung.',
'Of what use is fortune or talent to a cold and defective nature?',
'Who cares what sensibility or discrimination a man has at some time shown, if he falls asleep in his chair? or if he laugh and giggle? or if he apologize? or is infected with egotism? or thinks of his dollar? or cannot go by food? or has gotten a child in his boyhood?',
'Of what use is genius, if the organ is too convex or too concave and cannot find a focal distance within the actual horizon of human life?',
'Of what use, if the brain is too cold or too hot, and the man does not care enough for results to stimulate him to experiment, and hold him up in it? or if the web is too finely woven, too irritable by pleasure and pain,',
'so that life stagnates from too much reception without due outlet?',
'Of what use to make heroic vows of amendment, if the same old law-breaker is to keep them?',
'What cheer can the religious sentiment yield, when that is suspected to be secretly dependent on the seasons of the year and the state of the blood?',
'I knew a witty physician who found the creed in the biliary duct, and used to affirm that if there was disease in the liver, the man became a Calvinist, and if that organ was sound, he became a Unitarian.',
'Very mortifying is the reluctant experience that some unfriendly excess or imbecility neutralizes the promise of genius.',
'We see young men who owe us a new world, so readily and lavishly they promise, but they never acquit the debt; they die young and dodge the account; or if they live they lose themselves in the crowd.',
'Temperament also enters fully into the system of illusions and shuts us in a prison of glass which we cannot see.',
'There is an optical illusion about every person we meet.',
'In truth they are all creatures of given temperament, which will appear in a given character, whose boundaries they will never pass: but we look at them, they seem alive, and we presume there is impulse in them.',
'In the moment it seems impulse; in the year, in the lifetime, it turns out to be a certain uniform tune which the revolving barrel of the music-box must play.',
'Men resist the conclusion in the morning, but adopt it as the evening wears on, that temper prevails over everything of time, place, and condition, and is inconsumable in the flames of religion.',
'Some modifications the moral sentiment avails to impose, but the individual texture holds its dominion, if not to bias the moral judgments, yet to fix the measure of activity and of enjoyment.',
'I thus express the law as it is read from the platform of ordinary life, but must not leave it without noticing the capital exception.',
'For temperament is a power which no man willingly hears any one praise but himself.',
'On the platform of physics we cannot resist the contracting influences of so-called science.',
'Temperament puts all divinity to rout.',
'I know the mental proclivity of physicians.',
'I hear the chuckle of the phrenologists.',
'Theoretic kidnappers and slave-drivers, they esteem each man the victim of another, who winds him round his finger by knowing the law of his being;',
'and by such cheap signboards as the color of his beard or the slope of his occiput, reads the inventory of his fortunes and character.',
'The grossest ignorance does not disgust like this impudent knowingness.',
'The physicians say they are not materialists; but they are:—Spirit is matter reduced to an extreme thinness: O so thin!—But the definition of spiritual should be, that which is its own evidence.',
'What notions do they attach to love! what to religion!',
'One would not willingly pronounce these words in their hearing, and give them the occasion to profane them.',
'I saw a gracious gentleman who adapts his conversation to the form of the head of the man he talks with!',
'I had fancied that the value of life lay in its inscrutable possibilities; in the fact that I never know, in addressing myself to a new individual, what may befall me.',
'I carry the keys of my castle in my hand, ready to throw them at the feet of my lord, whenever and in what disguise soever he shall appear.',
'I know he is in the neighborhood hidden among vagabonds.',
'Shall I preclude my future by taking a high seat and kindly adapting my conversation to the shape of heads?',
'When I come to that, the doctors shall buy me for a cent.—‘But, sir, medical history; the report to the Institute; the proven facts!’—I distrust the facts and the inferences.',
'Temperament is the veto or limitation-power in the constitution, very justly applied to restrain an opposite excess in the constitution, but absurdly offered as a bar to original equity.',
'When virtue is in presence, all subordinate powers sleep.',
'On its own level, or in view of nature, temperament is final.',
'I see not, if one be once caught in this trap of so-called sciences, any escape for the man from the links of the chain of physical necessity.',
'Given such an embryo, such a history must follow.',
'On this platform one lives in a sty of sensualism, and would soon come to suicide.',
'But it is impossible that the creative power should exclude itself.',
'Into every intelligence there is a door which is never closed, through which the creator passes.',

'We hurl it into its own hell, and cannot again contract ourselves to so base a state.',
'The secret of the illusoriness is in the necessity of a succession of moods or objects.',
'Gladly we would anchor, but the anchorage is quicksand.',
'This onward trick of nature is too strong for us: Pero si muove.',
'When at night I look at the moon and stars, I seem stationary, and they to hurry.',
'Our love of the real draws us to permanence, but health of body consists in circulation, and sanity of mind in variety or facility of association.',
'We need change of objects.',
'Dedication to one thought is quickly odious.',
'We house with the insane, and must humor them; then conversation dies out.',
'Once I took such delight in Montaigne, that I thought I should not need any other book;',
'before that, in Shakspeare;',
'then in Plutarch;',
'then in Plotinus;',
'at one time in Bacon;',
'afterwards in Goethe;',
'even in Bettine;',
'but now I turn the pages of either of them languidly, whilst I still cherish their genius.',
'So with pictures; each will bear an emphasis of attention once, which it cannot retain, though we fain would continue to be pleased in that manner.',
'How strongly I have felt of pictures that when you have seen one well, you must take your leave of it; you shall never see it again.',
'I have had good lessons from pictures which I have since seen without emotion or remark.',
'A deduction must be made from the opinion which even the wise express of a new book or occurrence.',
'Their opinion gives me tidings of their mood, and some vague guess at the new fact, but is nowise to be trusted as the lasting relation between that intellect and that thing.',
'The child asks, ‘Mamma, why don’t I like the story as well as when you told it me yesterday?’',
'Alas! child it is even so with the oldest cherubim of knowledge.',
'But will it answer thy question to say, Because thou wert born to a whole and this story is a particular?',
'The reason of the pain this discovery causes us (and we make it late in respect to works of art and intellect), is the plaint of tragedy which murmurs from it in regard to persons, to friendship and love.',
'That immobility and absence of elasticity which we find in the arts, we find with more pain in the artist.',
'There is no power of expansion in men.',
'Our friends early appear to us as representatives of certain ideas which they never pass or exceed.',
'They stand on the brink of the ocean of thought and power, but they never take the single step that would bring them there.',
'A man is like a bit of Labrador spar, which has no lustre as you turn it in your hand until you come to a particular angle; then it shows deep and beautiful colors.',
'There is no adaptation or universal applicability in men, but each has his special talent, and the mastery of successful men consists in adroitly keeping themselves where and when that turn shall be oftenest to be practised.',

'Like a bird which alights nowhere, but hops perpetually from bough to bough, is the Power which abides in no man and in no woman, but for a moment speaks from this one, and for another moment from that one.',
'But what help from these fineries or pedantries?',
'What help from thought?',
'Life is not dialectics.',
'We, I think, in these times, have had lessons enough of the futility of criticism.',

'Men live in their fancy, like drunkards whose hands are too soft and tremulous for successful labor.',
'It is a tempest of fancies, and the only ballast I know is a respect to the present hour.',
'Without any shadow of doubt, amidst this vertigo of shows and politics, I settle myself ever the firmer in the creed that we should not postpone and refer and wish,',
'but do broad justice where we are, by whomsoever we deal with, accepting our actual companions and circumstances, however humble or odious as the mystic officials to whom the universe has delegated its whole pleasure for us.',
'If these are mean and malignant, their contentment, which is the last victory of justice, is a more satisfying echo to the heart than the voice of poets and the casual sympathy of admirable persons.',
'I think that however a thoughtful man may suffer from the defects and absurdities of his company, he cannot without affectation deny to any set of men and women a sensibility to extraordinary merit.',
'The coarse and frivolous have an instinct of superiority, if they have not a sympathy, and honor it in their blind capricious way with sincere homage.',
'The fine young people despise life, but in me, and in such as with me are free from dyspepsia, and to whom a day is a sound and solid good, it is a great excess of politeness to look scornful and to cry for company.',
'I am grown by sympathy a little eager and sentimental, but leave me alone and I should relish every hour and what it brought me, the potluck of the day, as heartily as the oldest gossip in the bar-room.',

'The great gifts are not got by analysis.',
'Everything good is on the highway.',
'The middle region of our being is the temperate zone.',
'We may climb into the thin and cold realm of pure geometry and lifeless science, or sink into that of sensation.',

'Moreover, in popular experience everything good is on the highway.',
'A collector peeps into all the picture-shops of Europe for a landscape of Poussin, a crayon-sketch of Salvator;',
'but the Transfiguration, the Last Judgment, the Communion of St. Jerome, and what are as transcendent as these, are on the walls of the Vatican, the Uffizii, or the Louvre, where every footman may see them;',
'to say nothing of Nature’s pictures in every street, of sunsets and sunrises every day, and the sculpture of the human body never absent.',

'But the exclusion reaches them also; reaches the climbing, flying, gliding, feathered and four-footed man.',
'Fox and woodchuck, hawk and snipe and bittern, when nearly seen, have no more root in the deep world than man, and are just such superficial tenants of the globe.',
'Then the new molecular philosophy shows astronomical interspaces betwixt atom and atom, shows that the world is all outside; it has no inside.',
'The mid-world is best.',

'The lights of the church, the ascetics, Gentoos, and corn-eaters, she does not distinguish by any favor.',
'She comes eating and drinking and sinning.',
'Her darlings, the great, the strong, the beautiful, are not children of our law; do not come out of the Sunday School, nor weigh their food, nor punctually keep the commandments.',

'Law of copyright and international copyright is to be discussed, and in the interim we will sell our books for the most we can.',
'Expediency of literature, reason of literature, lawfulness of writing down a thought, is questioned; much is to say on both sides, and, while the fight waxes hot, thou, dearest scholar, stick to thy foolish task, add a line every hour, and between whiles add a line.',
'Right to hold land, right of property, is disputed, and the conventions convene, and before the vote is taken, dig away in your garden, and spend your earnings as a waif or godsend to all serene and beautiful purposes.',
'Life itself is a bubble and a skepticism, and a sleep within a sleep.',

'Human life is made up of the two elements, power and form, and the proportion must be invariably kept if we would have it sweet and sound.',
'Each of these elements in excess makes a mischief as hurtful as its defect.',
'Everything runs to excess; every good quality is noxious if unmixed, and, to carry the danger to the edge of ruin, nature causes each man’s peculiarity to superabound.',
'Here, among the farms, we adduce the scholars as examples of this treachery.',
'They are nature’s victims of expression.',
'You who see the artist, the orator, the poet, too near, and find their life no more excellent than that of mechanics or farmers, and themselves victims of partiality, very hollow and haggard, and pronounce them failures, not heroes, but quacks,—',

'Yet nature will not bear you out.',
'Irresistible nature made men such, and makes legions more of such, every day.',
'You love the boy reading in a book, gazing at a drawing, or a cast; yet what are these millions who read and behold, but incipient writers and sculptors?',

'In the street and in the newspapers, life appears so plain a business that manly resolution and adherence to the multiplication-table through all weathers will insure success.',
'But ah! presently comes a day, or is it only a half-hour, with its angel-whispering,—which discomfits the conclusions of nations and of years!',
'Tomorrow again everything looks real and angular, the habitual standards are reinstated, common sense is as rare as genius,—',
'is the basis of genius, and experience is hands and feet to every enterprise;—and yet, he who should do his business on this understanding would be quickly bankrupt.',
'Power keeps quite another road than the turnpikes of choice and will; namely the subterranean and invisible tunnels and channels of life.',

'The ardors of piety agree at last with the coldest skepticism,—that nothing is of us or our works,—that all is of God.',
'Nature will not spare us the smallest leaf of laurel.',
'All writing comes by the grace of God, and all doing and having.',
'I would gladly be moral and keep due metes and bounds, which I dearly love, and allow the most to the will of man; but I have set my heart on honesty in this chapter, and I can see nothing at last, in success or failure, than more or less of vital force supplied from the Eternal.',
'The results of life are uncalculated and uncalculable.',
'The years teach much which the days never know.',
'The persons who compose our company, converse, and come and go, and design and execute many things, and somewhat comes of it all, but an unlooked-for result.',

'In the growth of the embryo, Sir Everard Home I think noticed that the evolution was not from one central point, but coactive from three or more points.',
'Life has no memory.',
'That which proceeds in succession might be remembered, but that which is coexistent, or ejaculated from a deeper cause, as yet far from being conscious, knows not its own tendency.',
'So is it with us, now skeptical or without unity, because immersed in forms and effects all seeming to be of equal yet hostile value, and now religious, whilst in the reception of spiritual law.',
'Bear with these distractions, with this coetaneous growth of the parts; they will one day be members, and obey one will.',
'On that one will, on that secret cause, they nail our attention and hope.',
'Life is hereby melted into an expectation or a religion.',
'Underneath the inharmonious and trivial particulars, is a musical perfection; the Ideal journeying always with us, the heaven without rent or seam.',

'When I converse with a profound mind, or if at any time being alone I have good thoughts, I do not at once arrive at satisfactions, as when, being thirsty, I drink water;',
'or go to the fire, being cold;',
'no! but I am at first apprised of my vicinity to a new and excellent region of life.',
'By persisting to read or to think, this region gives further sign of itself,',
'as it were in flashes of light, in sudden discoveries of its profound beauty and repose,',
'as if the clouds that covered it parted at intervals and showed the approaching traveller the inland mountains, with the tranquil eternal meadows spread at their base, whereon flocks graze and shepherds pipe and dance.',
'But every insight from this realm of thought is felt as initial, and promises a sequel.',
'I do not make it; I arrive there, and behold what was there already.',
'I make!',
'O no!',
'I clap my hands in infantine joy and amazement before the first opening to me of this august magnificence, old with the love and homage of innumerable ages, young with the life of life, the sunbright Mecca of the desert.',
'And what a future it opens!',
'I feel a new heart beating with the love of the new beauty.',
'I am ready to die out of nature and be born again into this new yet unapproachable America I have found in the West:—',
'“Since neither now nor yesterday began',
'These thoughts, which have been ever, nor yet can',
'A man be found who their first entrance knew.”',
'If I have described life as a flux of moods, I must now add that there is that in us which changes not and which ranks all sensations and states of mind.',
'The consciousness in each man is a sliding scale, which identifies him now with the First Cause, and now with the flesh of his body; life above life, in infinite degrees.',
'The sentiment from which it sprung determines the dignity of any deed, and the question ever is, not what you have done or forborne, but at whose command you have done or forborne it.',
'Fortune, Minerva, Muse, Holy Ghost,—these are quaint names, too narrow to cover this unbounded substance.',
'The baffled intellect must still kneel before this cause,',
'which refuses to be named,—ineffable cause,',
'which every fine genius has essayed to represent by some emphatic symbol, as, Thales by water, Anaximenes by air, Anaxagoras by (Nous) thought, Zoroaster by fire, Jesus and the moderns by love;',
'and the metaphor of each has become a national religion.',
'The Chinese Mencius has not been the least successful in his generalization.',
'“I fully understand language,” he said, “and nourish well my vast-flowing vigor.”—“I beg to ask what you call vast-flowing vigor?”—said his companion.',
'“The explanation,” replied Mencius, “is difficult.',
'This vigor is supremely great, and in the highest degree unbending.',
'Nourish it correctly and do it no injury, and it will fill up the vacancy between heaven and earth.',
'This vigor accords with and assists justice and reason, and leaves no hunger.”—In our more correct writing we give to this generalization the name of Being, and thereby confess that we have arrived as far as we can go.',
'Suffice it for the joy of the universe that we have not arrived at a wall, but at interminable oceans.',
'Our life seems not present so much as prospective; not for the affairs on which it is wasted, but as a hint of this vast-flowing vigor.',
'Most of life seems to be mere advertisement of faculty; information is given us not to sell ourselves cheap; that we are very great.',
'So, in particulars, our greatness is always in a tendency or direction, not in an action.',
'It is for us to believe in the rule, not in the exception.',
'The noble are thus known from the ignoble.',
'So in accepting the leading of the sentiments, it is not what we believe concerning the immortality of the soul or the like, but the universal impulse to believe, that is the material circumstance and is the principal fact in the history of the globe.',
'Shall we describe this cause as that which works directly?',
'The spirit is not helpless or needful of mediate organs.',
'It has plentiful powers and direct effects.',
'I am explained without explaining, I am felt without acting, and where I am not.',
'Therefore all just persons are satisfied with their own praise.',
'They refuse to explain themselves, and are content that new actions should do them that office.',
'They believe that we communicate without speech and above speech, and that no right action of ours is quite unaffecting to our friends, at whatever distance; for the influence of action is not to be measured by miles.',
'Why should I fret myself because a circumstance has occurred which hinders my presence where I was expected?',
'If I am not at the meeting, my presence where I am should be as useful to the commonwealth of friendship and wisdom, as would be my presence in that place.',

'Thus journeys the mighty Ideal before us; it never was known to fall into the rear.',
'No man ever came to an experience which was satiating, but his good is tidings of a better.',
'Onward and onward!',
'In liberated moments we know that a new picture of life and duty is already possible; the elements already exist in many minds around you of a doctrine of life which shall transcend any written record we have.',
'The new statement will comprise the skepticisms as well as the faiths of society, and out of unbeliefs a creed shall be formed.',
'For skepticisms are not gratuitous or lawless, but are limitations of the affirmative statement, and the new philosophy must take them in and make affirmations outside of them, just as much as it must include the oldest beliefs.',
'It is very unhappy, but too late to be helped, the discovery we have made that we exist.',
'That discovery is called the Fall of Man.',
'Ever afterwards we suspect our instruments.',
'We have learned that we do not see directly, but mediately, and that we have no means of correcting these colored and distorting lenses which we are, or of computing the amount of their errors.',
'Perhaps these subject-lenses have a creative power; perhaps there are no objects.',

'The street is full of humiliations to the proud.',
'As the fop contrived to dress his bailiffs in his livery and make them wait on his guests at table,',
'so the chagrins which the bad heart gives off as bubbles, at once take form as ladies and gentlemen in the street, shopmen or bar-keepers in hotels, and threaten or insult whatever is threatenable and insultable in us.',
'‘Tis the same with our idolatries.',
'People forget that it is the eye which makes the horizon, and the rounding mind’s eye which makes this or that man a type or representative of humanity, with the name of hero or saint.',
'Jesus, the “providential man,” is a good man on whom many people are agreed that these optical laws shall take effect.',
'By love on one part and by forbearance to press objection on the other part, it is for a time settled, that we will look at him in the centre of the horizon, and ascribe to him the properties that will attach to any man so seen.',
'But the longest love or aversion has a speedy term.',
'The great and crescive self, rooted in absolute nature, supplants all relative existence and ruins the kingdom of mortal friendship and love.',
'Marriage (in what is called the spiritual world) is impossible, because of the inequality between every subject and every object.',
'The subject is the receiver of Godhead, and at every comparison must feel his being enhanced by that cryptic might.',

'Never can love make consciousness and ascription equal in force.',
'There will be the same gulf between every me and thee as between the original and the picture.',
'The universe is the bride of the soul.',
'All private sympathy is partial.',
'Two human beings are like globes, which can touch only in a point, and whilst they remain in contact, all other points of each of the spheres are inert; their turn must also come, and the longer a particular union lasts the more energy of appetency the parts not in union acquire.',
'Life will be imaged, but cannot be divided nor doubled.',
'Any invasion of its unity would be chaos.',
'The soul is not twin-born but the only begotten, and though revealing itself as child in time, child in appearance, is of a fatal and universal power, admitting no co-life.',
'Every day, every act betrays the ill-concealed deity.',
'We believe in ourselves as we do not believe in others.',
'We permit all things to ourselves, and that which we call sin in others is experiment for us.',
'It is an instance of our faith in ourselves that men never speak of crime as lightly as they think; or every man thinks a latitude safe for himself which is nowise to be indulged to another.',
'The act looks very differently on the inside and on the outside; in its quality and in its consequences.',
'Murder in the murderer is no such ruinous thought as poets and romancers will have it;',
'it does not unsettle him or fright him from his ordinary notice of trifles;',
'it is an act quite easy to be contemplated;',
'but in its sequel it turns out to be a horrible jangle and confounding of all relations.',
'Especially the crimes that spring from love seem right and fair from the actor’s point of view, but when acted are found destructive of society.',
'No man at last believes that he can be lost, nor that the crime in him is as black as in the felon.',
'Because the intellect qualifies in our own case the moral judgments.',
'For there is no crime to the intellect.',
'That is antinomian or hypernomian, and judges law as well as fact.',
'“It is worse than a crime, it is a blunder,” said Napoleon, speaking the language of the intellect.',
'To it, the world is a problem in mathematics or the science of quantity, and it leaves out praise and blame and all weak emotions.',
'All stealing is comparative.',
'If you come to absolutes, pray who does not steal?',
'Saints are sad, because they behold sin (even when they speculate), from the point of view of the conscience, and not of the intellect; a confusion of thought.',
'Sin, seen from the thought, is a diminution, or less: seen from the conscience or will, it is pravity or bad.',
'The intellect names it shade, absence of light, and no essence.',
'The conscience must feel it as essence, essential evil.',
'This it is not; it has an objective existence, but no subjective.',
'Thus inevitably does the universe wear our color, and every object fall successively into the subject itself.',
'The subject exists, the subject enlarges; all things sooner or later fall into place.',

'What imports it whether it is Kepler and the sphere, Columbus and America, a reader and his book, or puss with her tail?',
'It is true that all the muses and love and religion hate these developments, and will find a way to punish the chemist who publishes in the parlor the secrets of the laboratory.',
'And we cannot say too little of our constitutional necessity of seeing things under private aspects, or saturated with our humors.',
'And yet is the God the native of these bleak rocks.',
'That need makes in morals the capital virtue of self-trust.',
'We must hold hard to this poverty, however scandalous, and by more vigorous self-recoveries, after the sallies of action, possess our axis more firmly.',
'The life of truth is cold and so far mournful; but it is not the slave of tears, contritions and perturbations.',
'It does not attempt another’s work, nor adopt another’s facts.',
'It is a main lesson of wisdom to know your own from another’s.',
'I have learned that I cannot dispose of other people’s facts; but I possess such a key to my own as persuades me, against all their denials, that they also have a key to theirs.',

'I am not the novice I was fourteen, nor yet seven years ago.',
'Let who will ask Where is the fruit?',
'I find a private fruit sufficient.',
'This is a fruit,—that I should not ask for a rash effect from meditations, counsels and the hiving of truths.',
'I should feel it pitiful to demand a result on this town and county, an overt effect on the instant month and year.',
'The effect is deep and secular as the cause.',
'It works on periods in which mortal lifetime is lost.',
'All I know is reception; I am and I have: but I do not get, and when I have fancied I had gotten anything, I found I did not.',

'My reception has been so large, that I am not annoyed by receiving this or that superabundantly.',
'I say to the Genius, if he will pardon the proverb, In for a mill, in for a million.',
'When I receive a new gift, I do not macerate my body to make the account square, for if I should die I could not make the account square.',
'The benefit overran the merit the first day, and has overrun the merit ever since.',
'The merit itself, so-called, I reckon part of the receiving.',

'I know that the world I converse with in the city and in the farms, is not the world I think.',
'I observe that difference, and shall observe it.',
'One day I shall know the value and law of this discrepance.',
'But I have not found that much was gained by manipular attempts to realize the world of thought.',
'Many eager persons successively make an experiment in this way, and make themselves ridiculous.',

'We dress our garden, eat our dinners, discuss the household with our wives, and these things make no impression, are forgotten next week;',
'but, in the solitude to which every man is always returning, he has a sanity and revelations which in his passage into new worlds he will carry with him.',
'Never mind the ridicule, never mind the defeat; up again, old heart!—it seems to say,—there is victory yet for all justice; and the true romance which the world exists to realize will be the transformation of genius into practical power.',
'III: CHARACTER.',
'The sun set; but set not his hope:',
'Stars rose; his faith was earlier up:',
'Fixed on the enormous galaxy,',
'Deeper and older seemed his eye:',
'And matched his sufferance sublime',
'The taciturnity of time.',
'He spoke, and words more soft than rain',
'Brought the Age of Gold again:',
'His action won such reverence sweet,',
'As hid all measure of the feat.',
'Work of his hand',
'He nor commends nor grieves',
'Pleads for itself the fact;',
'As unrepenting Nature leaves',
'Her every act.',
'I HAVE read that those who listened to Lord Chatham felt that there was something finer in the man than any thing which he said.',

'We cannot find the smallest part of the personal weight of Washington in the narrative of his exploits.',
'The authority of the name of Schiller is too great for his books.',
'This inequality of the reputation to the works or the anecdotes is not accounted for by saying that the reverberation is longer than the thunder-clap, but somewhat resided in these men which begot an expectation that outran all their performance.',
'The largest part of their power was latent.',
'This is that which we call Character,—a reserved force which acts directly by presence, and without means.',
'It is conceived of as a certain undemonstrable force, a Familiar or Genius, by whose impulses the man is guided but whose counsels he cannot impart;',
'which is company for him, so that such men are often solitary, or if they chance to be social, do not need society but can entertain themselves very well alone.',
'The purest literary talent appears at one time great, at another time small, but character is of a stellar and undiminishable greatness.',
'What others effect by talent or by eloquence, this man accomplishes by some magnetism.',
'“Half his strength he put not forth.”',
'His victories are by demonstration of superiority, and not by crossing of bayonets.',
'He conquers because his arrival alters the face of affairs.',

'“Because,” answered Iole, “I was content the moment my eyes fell on him.',
'When I beheld Theseus, I desired that I might see him offer battle, or at least guide his horses in the chariot-race; but Hercules did not wait for a contest; he conquered whether he stood, or walked, or sat, or whatever thing he did.”',
'Man, ordinarily a pendant to events, only half attached, and that awkwardly, to the world he lives in, in these examples appears to share the life of things, and to be an expression of the same laws which control the tides and the sun, numbers and quantities.',
'But to use a more modest illustration and nearer home, I observe that in our political elections, where this element, if it appears at all, can only occur in its coarsest form, we sufficiently understand its incomparable rate.',
'The people know that they need in their representative much more than talent, namely the power to make his talent trusted.',
'They cannot come at their ends by sending to Congress a learned, acute, and fluent speaker, if he be not one who, before he was appointed by the people to represent them, was appointed by Almighty God to stand for a fact,—',
'invincibly persuaded of that fact in himself,—',
'so that the most confident and the most violent persons learn that here is resistance on which both impudence and terror are wasted, namely faith in a fact.',
'The men who carry their points do not need to inquire of their constituents what they should say, but are themselves the country which they represent; nowhere are its emotions or opinions so instant and true as in them; nowhere so pure from a selfish infusion.',

'It lies in the man; that is all anybody can tell you about it.',
'See him and you will know as easily why he succeeds, as, if you see Napoleon, you would comprehend his fortune.',
'In the new objects we recognize the old game, the Habit of fronting the fact, and not dealing with it at second hand, through the perceptions of somebody else.',
'Nature seems to authorize trade, as soon as you see the natural merchant, who appears not so much a private agent as her factor and Minister of Commerce.',
'His natural probity combines with his insight into the fabric of society to put him above tricks, and he communicates to all his own faith that contracts are of no private interpretation.',
'The habit of his mind is a reference to standards of natural equity and public advantage; and he inspires respect and the wish to deal with him, both for the quiet spirit of honor which attends him, and for the intellectual pastime which the spectacle of so much ability affords.',
'This immensely stretched trade, which makes the capes of the Southern Ocean his wharves, and the Atlantic Sea his familiar port, centres in his brain only; and nobody in the universe can make his place good.',
'In his parlor I see very well that he has been at hard work this morning, with that knitted brow and that settled humor, which all his desire to be courteous cannot shake off.',
'I see plainly how many firm acts have been done; how many valiant noes have this day been spoken, when others would have uttered ruinous yeas.',
'I see, with the pride of art and skill of masterly arithmetic and power of remote combination, the consciousness of being an agent and playfellow of the original laws of the world.',
'He too believes that none can supply him, and that a man must be born to trade or he cannot learn it.',
'This virtue draws the mind more when it appears in action to ends not so mixed.',
'It works with most energy in the smallest companies and in private relations.',
'In all cases it is an extraordinary and incomputable agent.',
'The excess of physical strength is paralyzed by it.',
'Higher natures overpower lower ones by affecting them with a certain sleep.',

'When they arrive at Cuba, will the relative order of the ship’s company be the same?',
'Is there nothing but rope and iron?',
'Is there no love, no reverence?',
'Is there never a glimpse of right in a poor slave-captain’s mind; and cannot these be supposed available to break or elude or in any manner overmatch the tension of an inch or two of iron ring?',

'The reason why we feel one man’s presence and do not feel another’s is as simple as gravity.',
'Truth is the summit of being; justice is the application of it to affairs.',
'All individual natures stand in a scale, according to the purity of this element in them.',
'The will of the pure runs down from them into other natures as water runs down from a higher into a lower vessel.',
'This natural force is no more to be withstood than any other natural force.',
'We can drive a stone upward for a moment into the air, but it is yet true that all stones will forever fall;',
'and whatever instances can be quoted of unpunished theft, or of a lie which somebody credited, justice must prevail, and it is the privilege of truth to make itself believed.',
'Character is this moral order seen through the medium of an individual nature.',
'An individual is an encloser.',
'Time and space, liberty and necessity, truth and thought, are left at large no longer.',
'Now, the universe is a close or pound.',
'All things exist in the man tinged with the manners of his soul.',
'With what quality is in him he infuses all nature that he can reach; nor does he tend to lose himself in vastness, but, at how long a curve soever, all his regards return into his own good at last.',
'He animates all he can, and he sees only what he animates.',
'He encloses the world, as the patriot does his country, as a material basis for his character, and a theatre for action.',
'A healthy soul stands united with the Just and the True, as the magnet arranges itself with the pole; so that he stands to all beholders like a transparent object betwixt them and the sun, and whoso journeys towards the sun, journeys towards that person.',
'He is thus the medium of the highest influence to all who are not on the same level.',
'Thus, men of character are the conscience of the society to which they belong.',
'The natural measure of this power is the resistance of circumstances.',
'Impure men consider life as it is reflected in opinions, events, and persons.',
'They cannot see the action until it is done.',
'Yet its moral element preexisted in the actor, and its quality as right or wrong it was easy to predict.',
'Everything in nature is bipolar, or has a positive and negative pole.',
'There is a male and a female, a spirit and a fact, a north and a south.',
'Spirit is the positive, the event is the negative.',

'They never behold a principle until it is lodged in a person.',
'They do not wish to be lovely, but to be loved.',
'Men of character like to hear of their faults; the other class do not like to hear of faults; they worship events; secure to them a fact, a connection, a certain chain of circumstances, and they will ask no more.',
'The hero sees that the event is ancillary; it must follow him.',
'A given order of events has no power to secure to him the satisfaction which the imagination attaches to it;',
'the soul of goodness escapes from any set of circumstances;',
'whilst prosperity belongs to a certain mind, and will introduce that power and victory which is its natural fruit, into any order of events.',
'No change of circumstances can repair a defect of character.',
'We boast our emancipation from many superstitions; but if we have broken any idols it is through a transfer of the idolatry.',
'What have I gained, that I no longer immolate a bull to Jove or to Neptune, or a mouse to Hecate;',
'that I do not tremble before the Eumenides, or the Catholic Purgatory, or the Calvinistic Judgment-day,—if I quake at opinion, the public opinion, as we call it;',
'or at the threat of assault, or contumely, or bad neighbors, or poverty, or mutilation, or at the rumor of revolution, or of murder?',
'If I quake, what matters it what I quake at?',

'I find, where I thought myself poor, there was I most rich.',
'Thence comes a new intellectual exaltation, to be again rebuked by some new exhibition of character.',
'Strange alternation of attraction and repulsion!',
'Character repudiates intellect, yet excites it; and character passes into thought, is published so, and then is ashamed before new flashes of moral worth.',
'Character is nature in the highest form.',
'It is of no use to ape it or to contend with it.',
'Somewhat is possible of resistance, and of persistence, and of creation, to this power, which will foil all emulation.',
'This masterpiece is best where no hands but nature’s have been laid on it.',
'Care is taken that the greatly-destined shall slip up into life in the shade, with no thousand-eyed Athens to watch and blazon every new thought, every blushing emotion of young genius.',

'When I explored the source of their sanctity and charm for the imagination, it seemed as if each answered, ‘From my nonconformity; I never listened to your people’s law, or to what they call their gospel, and wasted my time.',
'I was content with the simple rural poverty of my own; hence this sweetness; my work never reminds you of that;—is pure of that.’',
'And nature advertises me in such persons that in democratic America she will not be democratized.',
'How cloistered and constitutionally sequestered from the market and from scandal!',
'It was only this morning that I sent away some wild flowers of these wood-gods.',
'They are a relief from literature,—these fresh draughts from the sources of thought and sentiment; as we read, in an age of polish and criticism, the first lines of written prose and verse of a nation.',
'How captivating is their devotion to their favorite books, whether Aeschylus, Dante, Shakspeare, or Scott, as feeling that they have a stake in that book;',
'who touches that, touches them;—and especially the total solitude of the critic, the Patmos of thought from which he writes, in unconsciousness of any eyes that shall ever read this writing.',
'Could they dream on still, as angels, and not wake to comparisons, and to be flattered!',
'Yet some natures are too good to be spoiled by praise, and wherever the vein of thought reaches down into the profound, there is no danger from vanity.',
'Solemn friends will warn them of the danger of the head’s being turned by the flourish of trumpets, but they can afford to smile.',
'I remember the indignation of an eloquent Methodist at the kind admonitions of a Doctor of Divinity,—‘My friend, a man can neither be praised nor insulted.’',
'But forgive the counsels; they are very natural.',
'I remember the thought which occurred to me when some ingenious and spiritual foreigners came to America, was, Have you been victimized in being brought hither?—or, prior to that, answer me this, ‘Are you victimizable?’',
'As I have said, Nature keeps these sovereignties in her own hands, and however pertly our sermons and disciplines would divide some share of credit, and teach that the laws fashion the citizen, she goes her own gait and puts the wisest in the wrong.',
'She makes very light of gospels and prophets, as one who has a great many more to produce and no excess of time to spare on any one.',
'There is a class of men, individuals of which appear at long intervals, so eminently endowed with insight and virtue that they have been unanimously saluted as divine, and who seem to be an accumulation of that power we consider.',
'Divine persons are character born, or, to borrow a phrase from Napoleon, they are victory organized.',
'They are usually received with ill-will, because they are new and because they set a bound to the exaggeration that has been made of the personality of the last divine person.',
'Nature never rhymes her children, nor makes two men alike.',
'When we see a great man we fancy a resemblance to some historical person, and predict the sequel of his character and fortune; a result which he is sure to disappoint.',
'None will ever solve the problem of his character according to our prejudice, but only in his own high unprecedented way.',
'Character wants room; must not be crowded on by persons nor be judged from glimpses got in the press of affairs or on few occasions.',
'It needs perspective, as a great building.',
'It may not, probably does not, form relations rapidly; and we should not require rash explanation, either on the popular ethics, or on our own, of its action.',

'When the Yunani sage arrived at Balkh, the Persians tell us, Gushtasp appointed a day on which the Mobeds of every country should assemble, and a golden chair was placed for the Yunani sage.',

'“The virtuous prince confronts the gods, without any misgiving.',
'He waits a hundred ages till a sage comes, and does not doubt.',
'He who confronts the gods, without any misgiving, knows heaven; he who waits a hundred ages until a sage comes, without doubting, knows men.',

'the secrets that make him wretched either to keep or to betray must be yielded;—another, and he cannot speak, and the bones of his body seem to lose their cartilages;',
'the entrance of a friend adds grace, boldness, and eloquence to him;',

'What is so excellent as strict relations of amity, when they spring from this deep root?',
'The sufficient reply to the skeptic who doubts the power and the furniture of man, is in that possibility of joyful intercourse with persons, which makes the faith and practice of all reasonable men.',
'I know nothing which life has to offer so satisfying as the profound good understanding which can subsist after much exchange of good offices, between two virtuous men, each of whom is sure of himself and sure of his friend.',
'It is a happiness which postpones all other gratifications, and makes politics, and commerce, and churches, cheap.',
'For when men shall meet as they ought, each a benefactor, a shower of stars, clothed with thoughts, with deeds, with accomplishments, it should be the festival of nature which all things announce.',
'Of such friendship, love in the sexes is the first symbol, as all other things are symbols of love.',
'Those relations to the best men, which, at one time, we reckoned the romances of youth, become, in the progress of the character, the most solid enjoyment.',
'If it were possible to live in right relations with men!—if we could abstain from asking anything of them, from asking their praise, or help, or pity, and content us with compelling them through the virtue of the eldest laws!',

'Could we not pay our friend the compliment of truth, of silence, of forbearing?',
'Need we be so eager to seek him?',
'If we are related, we shall meet.',

'We chase some flying scheme, or we are hunted by some fear or command behind us.',

'The moment is all, in all noble relations.',

'Our beatitude waits for the fulfilment of these two in one.',
'The ages are opening this moral force.',
'All force is the shadow or symbol of that.',
'Poetry is joyful and strong as it draws its inspiration thence.',
'Men write their names on the world as they are filled with this.',
'History has been mean; our nations have been mobs; we have never seen a man: that divine form we do not yet know, but only the dream and prophecy of such: we do not know the majestic manners which belong to him, which appease and exalt the beholder.',

'What greatness has yet appeared is beginnings and encouragements to us in this direction.',
'The history of those gods and saints which the world has written and then worshipped, are documents of character.',
'The ages have exulted in the manners of a youth who owed nothing to fortune, and who was hanged at the Tyburn of his nation,',
'who, by the pure quality of his nature, shed an epic splendor around the facts of his death which has transfigured every particular into an universal symbol for the eyes of mankind.',
'This great defeat is hitherto our highest fact.',
'But the mind requires a victory to the senses; a force of character which will convert judge, jury, soldier, and king; which will rule animal and mineral virtues, and blend with the courses of sap, of rivers, of winds, of stars, and of moral agents.',
'If we cannot attain at a bound to these grandeurs, at least let us do them homage.',
'In society, high advantages are set down to the possessor as disadvantages.',
'It requires the more wariness in our private estimates.',
'I do not forgive in my friends the failure to know a fine character and to entertain it with thankful hospitality.',
'When at last that which we have always longed for is arrived and shines on us with glad rays out of that far celestial land,',
'then to be coarse, then to be critical and treat such a visitant with the jabber and suspicion of the streets, argues a vulgarity that seems to shut the doors of heaven.',
'This is confusion, this the right insanity, when the soul no longer knows its own, nor where its allegiance, its religion, are due.',
'Is there any religion but this, to know that wherever in the wide desert of being the holy sentiment we cherish has opened into a flower, it blooms for me? if none sees it, I see it; I am aware, if I alone, of the greatness of the fact.',
'Whilst it blooms, I will keep sabbath or holy time, and suspend my gloom and my folly and jokes.',
'Nature is indulged by the presence of this guest.',
'There are many eyes that can detect and honor the prudent and household virtues;',
'there are many that can discern Genius on his starry track, though the mob is incapable;',
'but when that love which is all-suffering, all-abstaining, all-aspiring,',
'which has vowed to itself that it will be a wretch and also a fool in this world sooner than soil its white hands by any compliances, comes into our streets and houses,—only the pure and aspiring can know its face, and the only compliment they can pay it is to own it.',
'IV: MANNERS.',
'“HOW near to good is what is fair!',
'Which we no sooner see,',
'But with the lines and outward air',
'Our senses taken be.',
'Again yourselves compose,',
'And now put all the aptness on',
'Of Figure, that Proportion',
'Or Color can disclose;',
'That if those silent arts were lost,',
'Design and Picture, they might boast',
'From you a newer ground,',
'Instructed by the heightening sense',
'Of dignity and reverence',
'In their true motions found.”',
'BEN JONSON',
'HALF the world, it is said, knows not how the other half live.',
'Our Exploring Expedition saw the Feejee islanders getting their dinner off human bones; and they are said to eat their own wives and children.',
'The husbandry of the modern inhabitants of Gournou (west of old Thebes) is philosophical to a fault.',
'To set up their housekeeping nothing is requisite but two or three earthen pots, a stone to grind meal, and a mat which is the bed.',
'The house, namely a tomb, is ready without rent or taxes.',
'No rain can pass through the roof, and there is no door, for there is no want of one, as there is nothing to lose.',
'If the house do not please them, they walk out and enter another, as there are several hundreds at their command.',
'“It is somewhat singular,” adds Belzoni, to whom we owe this account, “to talk of happiness among people who live in sepulchres, among the corpses and rags of an ancient nation which they know nothing of.”',
'In the deserts of Borgoo the rock-Tibboos still dwell in caves, like cliff-swallows, and the language of these negroes is compared by their neighbors to the shrieking of bats and to the whistling of birds.',
'Again, the Bornoos have no proper names; individuals are called after their height, thickness, or other accidental quality, and have nicknames merely.',
'But the salt, the dates, the ivory, and the gold, for which these horrible regions are visited, find their way into countries where the purchaser and consumer can hardly be ranked in one race with these cannibals and man-stealers;',
'countries where man serves himself with metals, wood, stone, glass, gum, cotton, silk, and wool;',
'honors himself with architecture;',
'writes laws, and contrives to execute his will through the hands of many nations;',
'and, especially, establishes a select society, running through all the countries of intelligent men, a self-constituted aristocracy, or fraternity of the best,',
'which, without written law or exact usage of any kind, perpetuates itself, colonizes every new-planted island and adopts and makes its own whatever personal beauty or extraordinary native endowment anywhere appears.',
'What fact more conspicuous in modern history than the creation of the gentleman?',
'Chivalry is that, and loyalty is that, and, in English literature, half the drama, and all the novels, from Sir Philip Sidney to Sir Walter Scott, paint this figure.',
'The word gentleman, which, like the word Christian, must hereafter characterize the present and the few preceding centuries by the importance attached to it, is a homage to personal and incommunicable properties.',
'Frivolous and fantastic additions have got associated with the name, but the steady interest of mankind in it must be attributed to the valuable properties which it designates.',
'An element which unites all the most forcible persons of every country;',
'makes them intelligible and agreeable to each other, and is somewhat so precise that it is at once felt if an individual lack the masonic sign,—cannot be any casual product, but must be an average result of the character and faculties universally found in men.',
'It seems a certain permanent average; as the atmosphere is a permanent composition, whilst so many gases are combined only to be decompounded.',
'Comme il faut, is the Frenchman’s description of good Society: as we must be.',
'It is a spontaneous fruit of talents and feelings of precisely that class who have most vigor, who take the lead in the world of this hour, and though far from pure, far from constituting the gladdest and highest tone of human feeling,',
'is as good as the whole society permits it to be.',
'It is made of the spirit, more than of the talent of men, and is a compound result into which every great force enters as an ingredient, namely virtue, wit, beauty, wealth, and power.',
'There is something equivocal in all the words in use to express the excellence of manners and social cultivation, because the quantities are fluxional, and the last effect is assumed by the senses as the cause.',
'The word gentleman has not any correlative abstract to express the quality.',
'Gentility is mean, and gentilesse is obsolete.',
'But we must keep alive in the vernacular the distinction between fashion, a word of narrow and often sinister meaning, and the heroic character which the gentleman imports.',
'The usual words, however, must be respected; they will be found to contain the root of the matter.',
'The point of distinction in all this class of names, as courtesy, chivalry, fashion, and the like, is that the flower and fruit, not the grain of the tree, are contemplated.',
'It is beauty which is the aim this time, and not worth.',
'The result is now in question, although our words intimate well enough the popular feeling that the appearance supposes a substance.',
'The gentleman is a man of truth, lord of his own actions, and expressing that lordship in his behavior, not in any manner dependent and servile, either on persons, or opinions, or possessions.',
'Beyond this fact of truth and real force, the word denotes good-nature or benevolence: manhood first, and then gentleness.',
'The popular notion certainly adds a condition of ease and fortune; but that is a natural result of personal force and love, that they should possess and dispense the goods of the world.',
'In times of violence, every eminent person must fall in with many opportunities to approve his stoutness and worth; therefore every man’s name that emerged at all from the mass in the feudal ages, rattles in our ear like a flourish of trumpets.',
'But personal force never goes out of fashion.',
'That is still paramount to-day, and in the moving crowd of good society the men of valor and reality are known and rise to their natural place.',
'The competition is transferred from war to politics and trade, but the personal force appears readily enough in these new arenas.',
'Power first, or no leading class.',
'In politics and in trade, bruisers and pirates are of better promise than talkers and clerks.',
'God knows that all sorts of gentlemen knock at the door; but whenever used in strictness and with any emphasis, the name will be found to point at original energy.',
'It describes a man standing in his own right and working after untaught methods.',
'In a good lord there must first be a good animal, at least to the extent of yielding the incomparable advantage of animal spirits.',
'The ruling class must have more, but they must have these, giving in every company the sense of power, which makes things easy to be done which daunt the wise.',
'The society of the energetic class, in their friendly and festive meetings, is full of courage and of attempts which intimidate the pale scholar.',
'The courage which girls exhibit is like a battle of Lundy’s Lane, or a sea-fight.',
'The intellect relies on memory to make some supplies to face these extemporaneous squadrons.',
'But memory is a base mendicant with basket and badge, in the presence of these sudden masters.',
'The rulers of society must be up to the work of the world, and equal to their versatile office: men of the right Caesarian pattern, who have great range of affinity.',
'I am far from believing the timid maxim of Lord Falkland (“that for ceremony there must go two to it;',
'since a bold fellow will go through the cunningest forms”), and am of opinion that the gentleman is the bold fellow whose forms are not to be broken through;',
'and only that plenteous nature is rightful master which is the complement of whatever person it converses with.',
'My gentleman gives the law where he is; he will outpray saints in chapel, outgeneral veterans in the field, and outshine all courtesy in the hall.',
'He is good company for pirates and good with academicians; so that it is useless to fortify yourself against him; he has the private entrance to all minds, and I could as easily exclude myself, as him.',
'The famous gentlemen of Asia and Europe have been of this strong type; Saladin, Sapor, the Cid, Julius Caesar, Scipio, Alexander, Pericles, and the lordliest personages.',
'They sat very carelessly in their chairs, and were too excellent themselves, to value any condition at a high rate.',
'A plentiful fortune is reckoned necessary, in the popular judgment, to the completion of this man of the world; and it is a material deputy which walks through the dance which the first has led.',
'Money is not essential, but this wide affinity is, which transcends the habits of clique and caste and makes itself felt by men of all classes.',
'If the aristocrat is only valid in fashionable circles and not with truckmen, he will never be a leader in fashion;',
'and if the man of the people cannot speak on equal terms with the gentleman, so that the gentleman shall perceive that he is already really of his own order, he is not to be feared.',
'Diogenes, Socrates, and Epaminondas, are gentlemen of the best blood who have chosen the condition of poverty when that of wealth was equally open to them.',
'I use these old names, but the men I speak of are my contemporaries.',
'Fortune will not supply to every generation one of these well-appointed knights, but every collection of men furnishes some example of the class;',
'and the politics of this country, and the trade of every town, are controlled by these hardy and irresponsible doers, who have invention to take the lead, and a broad sympathy which puts them in fellowship with crowds, and makes their action popular.',
'The manners of this class are observed and caught with devotion by men of taste.',
'The association of these masters with each other and with men intelligent of their merits, is mutually agreeable and stimulating.',
'The good forms, the happiest expressions of each, are repeated and adopted.',
'By swift consent everything superfluous is dropped, everything graceful is renewed.',
'Fine manners show themselves formidable to the uncultivated man.',
'They are a subtler science of defence to parry and intimidate;',
'but once matched by the skill of the other party, they drop the point of the sword,—points and fences disappear, and the youth finds himself in a more transparent atmosphere, wherein life is a less troublesome game, and not a misunderstanding rises between the players.',
'Manners aim to facilitate life, to get rid of impediments and bring the man pure to energize.',
'They aid our dealing and conversation as a railway aids travelling, by getting rid of all avoidable obstructions of the road and leaving nothing to be conquered but pure space.',
'These forms very soon become fixed, and a fine sense of propriety is cultivated with the more heed that it becomes a badge of social and civil distinctions.',
'Thus grows up Fashion, an equivocal semblance, the most puissant, the most fantastic and frivolous, the most feared and followed, and which morals and violence assault in vain.',
'There exists a strict relation between the class of power and the exclusive and polished circles.',
'The last are always filled or filling from the first.',
'The strong men usually give some allowance even to the petulances of fashion, for that affinity they find in it.',
'Napoleon, child of the revolution, destroyer of the old noblesse, never ceased to court the Faubourg St. Germain; doubtless with the feeling that fashion is a homage to men of his stamp.',
'Fashion, though in a strange way, represents all manly virtue.',
'It is virtue gone to seed: it is a kind of posthumous honor.',
'It does not often caress the great, but the children of the great: it is a hall of the Past.',
'It usually sets its face against the great of this hour.',
'Great men are not commonly in its halls; they are absent in the field: they are working, not triumphing.',
'Fashion is made up of their children;',
'of those who through the value and virtue of somebody, have acquired lustre to their name, marks of distinction, means of cultivation and generosity, and, in their physical organization a certain health and excellence which secures to them, if not the highest power to work,',
'yet high power to enjoy.',
'The class of power, the working heroes, the Cortez, the Nelson, the Napoleon, see that this is the festivity and permanent celebration of such as they;',
'that fashion is funded talent;',
'is Mexico, Marengo, and Trafalgar beaten out thin;',
'that the brilliant names of fashion run back to just such busy names as their own, fifty or sixty years ago.',
'They are the sowers, their sons shall be the reapers, and their sons, in the ordinary course of things, must yield the possession of the harvest to new competitors with keener eyes and stronger frames.',
'The city is recruited from the country.',
'In the year 1805, it is said, every legitimate monarch in Europe was imbecile.',
'The city would have died out, rotted, and exploded, long ago, but that it was reinforced from the fields.',
'It is only country which came to town day before yesterday that is city and court today.',
'Aristocracy and fashion are certain inevitable results.',
'These mutual selections are indestructible.',
'If they provoke anger in the least favored class, and the excluded majority revenge themselves on the excluding minority by the strong hand and kill them, at once a new class finds itself at the top, as certainly as cream rises in a bowl of milk:',
'and if the people should destroy class after class, until two men only were left, one of these would be the leader and would be involuntarily served and copied by the other.',
'You may keep this minority out of sight and out of mind, but it is tenacious of life, and is one of the estates of the realm.',
'I am the more struck with this tenacity, when I see its work.',
'It respects the administration of such unimportant matters, that we should not look for any durability in its rule.',
'We sometimes meet men under some strong moral influence, as a patriotic, a literary, a religious movement, and feel that the moral sentiment rules man and nature.',
'We think all other distinctions and ties will be slight and fugitive, this of caste or fashion for example; yet come from year to year and see how permanent that is, in this Boston or New York life of man, where too it has not the least countenance from the law of the land.',
'Not in Egypt or in India a firmer or more impassable line.',
'Here are associations whose ties go over and under and through it, a meeting of merchants, a military corps, a college class, a fire-club, a professional association, a political, a religious convention;—the persons seem to draw inseparably near;',
'yet, that assembly once dispersed, its members will not in the year meet again.',
'Each returns to his degree in the scale of good society, porcelain remains porcelain, and earthen earthen.',
'The objects of fashion may be frivolous, or fashion may be objectless, but the nature of this union and selection can be neither frivolous nor accidental.',
'Each man’s rank in that perfect graduation depends on some symmetry in his structure or some agreement in his structure to the symmetry of society.',
'Its doors unbar instantaneously to a natural claim of their own kind.',
'A natural gentleman finds his way in, and will keep the oldest patrician out who has lost his intrinsic rank.',
'Fashion understands itself; good-breeding and personal superiority of whatever country readily fraternize with those of every other.',
'The chiefs of savage tribes have distinguished themselves in London and Paris, by the purity of their tournure.',
'To say what good of fashion we can, it rests on reality, and hates nothing so much as pretenders; to exclude and mystify pretenders and send them into everlasting ‘Coventry,’ is its delight.',
'We contemn in turn every other gift of men of the world; but the habit even in little and the least matters of not appealing to any but our own sense of propriety, constitutes the foundation of all chivalry.',
'There is almost no kind of self-reliance, so it be sane and proportioned, which fashion does not occasionally adopt and give it the freedom of its saloons.',
'A sainted soul is always elegant, and, if it will, passes unchallenged into the most guarded ring.',
'But so will Jock the teamster pass, in some crisis that brings him thither, and find favor, as long as his head is not giddy with the new circumstance, and the iron shoes do not wish to dance in waltzes and cotillons.',
'For there is nothing settled in manners, but the laws of behavior yield to the energy of the individual.',
'The maiden at her first ball, the country-man at a city dinner, believes that there is a ritual according to which every act and compliment must be performed, or the failing party must be cast out of this presence.',
'Later they learn that good sense and character make their own forms every moment, and speak or abstain, take wine or refuse it, stay or go, sit in a chair or sprawl with children on the floor, or stand on their head, or what else soever, in a new and aboriginal way;',
'and that strong will is always in fashion, let who will be unfashionable.',
'All that fashion demands is composure and self-content.',
'A circle of men perfectly well-bred would be a company of sensible persons in which every man’s native manners and character appeared.',
'If the fashionist have not this quality, he is nothing.',
'We are such lovers of self-reliance that we excuse in a man many sins if he will show us a complete satisfaction in his position, which asks no leave to be, of mine, or any man’s good opinion.',
'But any deference to some eminent man or woman of the world, forfeits all privilege of nobility.',
'He is an underling: I have nothing to do with him; I will speak with his master.',
'A man should not go where he cannot carry his whole sphere or society with him,—not bodily, the whole circle of his friends, but atmospherically.',
'He should preserve in a new company the same attitude of mind and reality of relation which his daily associates draw him to, else he is shorn of his best beams, and will be an orphan in the merriest club.',
'“If you could see Vich Ian Vohr with his tail on!—” But Vich Ian Vohr must always carry his belongings in some fashion, if not added as honor, then severed as disgrace.',
'There will always be in society certain persons who are mercuries of its approbation, and whose glance will at any time determine for the curious their standing in the world.',
'These are the chamberlains of the lesser gods.',
'Accept their coldness as an omen of grace with the loftier deities, and allow them all their privilege.',
'They are clear in their office, nor could they be thus formidable without their own merits.',
'But do not measure the importance of this class by their pretension, or imagine that a fop can be the dispenser of honor and shame.',
'They pass also at their just rate; for how can they otherwise, in circles which exist as a sort of herald’s office for the sifting of character?',
'As the first thing man requires of man is reality, so that appears in all the forms of society.',
'We pointedly, and by name, introduce the parties to each other.',
'Know you before all heaven and earth, that this is Andrew, and this is Gregory,—they look each other in the eye; they grasp each other’s hand, to identify and signalize each other.',
'It is a great satisfaction.',
'A gentleman never dodges; his eyes look straight forward, and he assures the other party, first of all, that he has been met.',
'For what is it that we seek, in so many visits and hospitalities?',
'Is it your draperies, pictures, and decorations?',
'Or do we not insatiably ask, Was a man in the house?',
'I may easily go into a great household where there is much substance, excellent provision for comfort, luxury, and taste, and yet not encounter there any Amphitryon who shall subordinate these appendages.',
'I may go into a cottage, and find a farmer who feels that he is the man I have come to see, and fronts me accordingly.',
'It was therefore a very natural point of old feudal etiquette that a gentleman who received a visit, though it were of his sovereign, should not leave his roof, but should wait his arrival at the door of his house.',
'No house, though it were the Tuileries or the Escurial, is good for anything without a master.',
'And yet we are not often gratified by this hospitality.',
'Every body we know surrounds himself with a fine house, fine books, conservatory, gardens, equipage and all manner of toys, as screens to interpose between himself and his guest.',
'Does it not seem as if man was of a very sly, elusive nature, and dreaded nothing so much as a full rencontre front to front with his fellow?',
'It were unmerciful, I know, quite to abolish the use of these screens, which are of eminent convenience, whether the guest is too great or too little.',
'We call together many friends who keep each other in play, or by luxuries and ornaments we amuse the young people, and guard our retirement.',
'Or if perchance a searching realist comes to our gate, before whose eye we have no care to stand, then again we run to our curtain, and hide ourselves as Adam at the voice of the Lord God in the garden.',
'Cardinal Caprara, the Pope’s legate at Paris, defended himself from the glances of Napoleon by an immense pair of green spectacles.',
'Napoleon remarked them, and speedily managed to rally them off: and yet Napoleon, in his turn, was not great enough with eight hundred thousand troops at his back, to face a pair of freeborn eyes, but fenced himself with etiquette and within triple barriers of reserve;',
'and, as all the world knows from Madame de Stael, was wont, when he found himself observed, to discharge his face of all expression.',
'But emperors and rich men are by no means the most skilful masters of good manners.',
'No rentroll nor army-list can dignify skulking and dissimulation; and the first point of courtesy must always be truth, as really all the forms of good-breeding point that way.',
'I have just been reading, in Mr. Hazlitt’s translation, Montaigne’s account of his journey into Italy, and am struck with nothing more agreeably than the self-respecting fashions of the time.',
'His arrival in each place, the arrival of a gentleman of France, is an event of some consequence.',
'Wherever he goes he pays a visit to whatever prince or gentleman of note resides upon his road, as a duty to himself and to civilization.',
'When he leaves any house in which he has lodged for a few weeks, he causes his arms to be painted and hung up as a perpetual sign to the house, as was the custom of gentlemen.',
'The complement of this graceful self-respect, and that of all the points of good breeding I most require and insist upon, is deference.',
'I like that every chair should be a throne, and hold a king.',
'I prefer a tendency to stateliness to an excess of fellowship.',
'Let the incommunicable objects of nature and the metaphysical isolation of man teach us independence.',
'Let us not be too much acquainted.',
'I would have a man enter his house through a hall filled with heroic and sacred sculptures, that he might not want the hint of tranquillity and self-poise.',

'This is myrrh and rosemary to keep the other sweet.',
'Lovers Should guard their strangeness.',
'If they forgive too much, all slides into confusion and meanness.',
'It is easy to push this deference to a Chinese etiquette; but coolness and absence of heat and haste indicate fine qualities.',
'A gentleman makes no noise; a lady is serene.',
'Proportionate is our disgust at those invaders who fill a studious house with blast and running, to secure some paltry convenience.',
'Not less I dislike a low sympathy of each with his neighbor’s needs.',
'Must we have a good understanding with one another’s palates? as foolish people who have lived long together know when each wants salt or sugar.',
'I pray my companion, if he wishes for bread, to ask me for bread, and if he wishes for sassafras or arsenic, to ask me for them, and not to hold out his plate as if I knew already.',
'Every natural function can be dignified by deliberation and privacy.',
'Let us leave hurry to slaves.',
'The compliments and ceremonies of our breeding should signify, however remotely, the recollection of the grandeur of our destiny.',
'The flower of courtesy does not very well bide handling, but if we dare to open another leaf and explore what parts go to its conformation, we shall find also an intellectual quality.',
'To the leaders of men, the brain as well as the flesh and the heart must furnish a proportion.',
'Defect in manners is usually the defect of fine perceptions.',
'Men are too coarsely made for the delicacy of beautiful carriage and customs.',
'It is not quite sufficient to good-breeding, a union of kindness and independence.',

'Moral qualities rule the world, but at short distances the senses are despotic.',
'The same discrimination of fit and fair runs out, if with less rigor, into all parts of life.',
'The average spirit of the energetic class is good sense, acting under certain limitations and to certain ends.',
'It entertains every natural gift.',
'Social in its nature, it respects everything which tends to unite men.',
'It delights in measure.',
'The love of beauty is mainly the love of measure or proportion.',
'The person who screams, or uses the superlative degree, or converses with heat, puts whole drawing-rooms to flight.',
'If you wish to be loved, love measure.',
'You must have genius or a prodigious usefulness if you will hide the want of measure.',
'This perception comes in to polish and perfect the parts of the social instrument.',
'Society will pardon much to genius and special gifts, but, being in its nature a convention, it loves what is conventional, or what belongs to coming together.',
'That makes the good and bad of manners, namely what helps or hinders fellowship.',
'For fashion is not good sense absolute, but relative; not good sense private, but good sense entertaining company.',
'It hates corners and sharp points of character, hates quarrelsome, egotistical, solitary, and gloomy people;',
'hates whatever can interfere with total blending of parties;',
'whilst it values all peculiarities as in the highest degree refreshing, which can consist with good fellowship.',
'And besides the general infusion of wit to heighten civility, the direct splendor of intellectual power is ever welcome in fine society as the costliest addition to its rule and its credit.',
'The dry light must shine in to adorn our festival, but it must be tempered and shaded, or that will also offend.',
'Accuracy is essential to beauty, and quick perceptions to politeness, but not too quick perceptions.',
'One may be too punctual and too precise.',
'He must leave the omniscience of business at the door, when he comes into the palace of beauty.',
'Society loves creole natures, and sleepy languishing manners, so that they cover sense, grace and good-will: the air of drowsy strength, which disarms criticism;',
'perhaps because such a person seems to reserve himself for the best of the game, and not spend himself on surfaces;',
'an ignoring eye, which does not see the annoyances, shifts, and inconveniences that cloud the brow and smother the voice of the sensitive.',
'Therefore besides personal force and so much perception as constitutes unerring taste,',
'society demands in its patrician class another element already intimated, which it significantly terms good-nature,—expressing all degrees of generosity, from the lowest willingness and faculty to oblige, up to the heights of magnanimity and love.',
'Insight we must have, or we shall run against one another and miss the way to our food; but intellect is selfish and barren.',
'The secret of success in society is a certain heartiness and sympathy.',
'A man who is not happy in the company cannot find any word in his memory that will fit the occasion.',

'The favorites of society, and what it calls whole souls, are able men and of more spirit than wit, who have no uncomfortable egotism, but who exactly fill the hour and the company;',
'contented and contenting, at a marriage or a funeral, a ball or a jury, a water-party or a shooting-match.',
'England, which is rich in gentlemen, furnished, in the beginning of the present century, a good model of that genius which the world loves, in Mr. Fox, who added to his great abilities the most social disposition and real love of men.',
'Parliamentary history has few better passages than the debate in which Burke and Fox separated in the House of Commons; when Fox urged on his old friend the claims of old friendship with such tenderness that the house was moved to tears.',
'Another anecdote is so close to my matter, that I must hazard the story.',
'A tradesman who had long dunned him for a note of three hundred guineas, found him one day counting gold, and demanded payment:—“No,” said Fox, “I owe this money to Sheridan; it is a debt of honor; if an accident should happen to me, he has nothing to show.”',
'“Then,” said the creditor, “I change my debt into a debt of honor,” and tore the note in pieces.',
'Fox thanked the man for his confidence and paid him, saying, “his debt was of older standing, and Sheridan must wait.”',
'Lover of liberty, friend of the Hindoo, friend of the African slave, he possessed a great personal popularity; and Napoleon said of him on the occasion of his visit to Paris, in 1805, “Mr. Fox will always hold the first place in an assembly at the Tuileries.”',
'We may easily seem ridiculous in our eulogy of courtesy, whenever we insist on benevolence as its foundation.',
'The painted phantasm Fashion rises to cast a species of derision on what we say.',
'But I will neither be driven from some allowance to Fashion as a symbolic institution, nor from the belief that love is the basis of courtesy.',
'We must obtain that, if we can; but by all means we must affirm this.',
'Life owes much of its spirit to these sharp contrasts.',
'Fashion, which affects to be honor, is often, in all men’s experience, only a ballroom-code.',
'Yet so long as it is the highest circle in the imagination of the best heads on the planet, there is something necessary and excellent in it;',
'for it is not to be supposed that men have agreed to be the dupes of anything preposterous;',
'and the respect which these mysteries inspire in the most rude and sylvan characters, and the curiosity with which details of high life are read, betray the universality of the love of cultivated manners.',
'I know that a comic disparity would be felt, if we should enter the acknowledged ‘first circles’ and apply these terrific standards of justice, beauty, and benefit to the individuals actually found there.',
'Monarchs and heroes, sages and lovers, these gallants are not.',
'Fashion has many classes and many rules of probation and admission, and not the best alone.',
'There is not only the right of conquest, which genius pretends,—the individual demonstrating his natural aristocracy best of the best;—but less claims will pass for the time; for Fashion loves lions, and points like Circe to her horned company.',
'This gentleman is this afternoon arrived from Denmark;',

'and Signor Torre del Greco, who extinguished Vesuvius by pouring into it the Bay of Naples;',
'Spahi, the Persian ambassador;',
'and Tul Wil Shan, the exiled nabob of Nepaul, whose saddle is the new moon.—But these are monsters of one day, and to-morrow will be dismissed to their holes and dens;',
'for in these rooms every chair is waited for.',
'The artist, the scholar, and, in general, the clerisy, wins their way up into these places and get represented here, somewhat on this footing of conquest.',
'Another mode is to pass through all the degrees, spending a year and a day in St. Michael’s Square, being steeped in Cologne water, and perfumed, and dined, and introduced, and properly grounded in all the biography and politics and anecdotes of the boudoirs.',
'Yet these fineries may have grace and wit.',
'Let there be grotesque sculpture about the gates and offices of temples.',
'Let the creed and commandments even have the saucy homage of parody.',
'The forms of politeness universally express benevolence in superlative degrees.',
'What if they are in the mouths of selfish men, and used as means of selfishness?',
'What if the false gentleman almost bows the true out Of the world?',
'What if the false gentleman contrives so to address his companion as civilly to exclude all others from his discourse, and also to make them feel excluded?',
'Real service will not lose its nobleness.',
'All generosity is not merely French and sentimental; nor is it to be concealed that living blood and a passion of kindness does at last distinguish God’s gentleman from Fashion’s.',
'The epitaph of Sir Jenkin Grout is not wholly unintelligible to the present age:',
'“Here lies Sir Jenkin Grout, who loved his friend and persuaded his enemy:',
'what his mouth ate, his hand paid for:',
'what his servants robbed, he restored:',
'if a woman gave him pleasure, he supported her in pain:',
'he never forgot his children;',
'and whoso touched his finger, drew after it his whole body.”',
'Even the line of heroes is not utterly extinct.',
'There is still ever some admirable person in plain clothes, standing on the wharf, who jumps in to rescue a drowning man;',
'there is still some absurd inventor of charities;',
'some guide and comforter of runaway slaves;',
'some friend of Poland;',
'some Philhellene;',
'some fanatic who plants shade-trees for the second and third generation, and orchards when he is grown old;',
'some well-concealed piety;',
'some just man happy in an ill fame;',
'some youth ashamed of the favors of fortune and impatiently casting them on other shoulders.',
'And these are the centres of society, on which it returns for fresh impulses.',
'These are the creators of Fashion, which is an attempt to organize beauty of behavior.',
'The beautiful and the generous are, in the theory, the doctors and apostles of this church: Scipio, and the Cid, and Sir Philip Sidney, and Washington, and every pure and valiant heart who worshipped Beauty by word and by deed.',
'The persons who constitute the natural aristocracy are not found in the actual aristocracy, or only on its edge; as the chemical energy of the spectrum is found to be greatest just outside of the spectrum.',
'Yet that is the infirmity of the seneschals, who do not know their sovereign when he appears.',
'The theory of society supposes the existence and sovereignty of these.',
'It divines afar off their coming.',
'It says with the elder gods,—',
'“As Heaven and Earth are fairer far',
'Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;',
'And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth,',
'In form and shape compact and beautiful;',
'So, on our heels a fresh perfection treads;',
'A power, more strong in beauty, born of us,',
'And fated to excel us, as we pass',
'In glory that old Darkness:',
'————for, ‘tis the eternal law,',
'That first in beauty shall be first in might.”',
'Therefore, within the ethnical circle of good society there is a narrower and higher circle, concentration of its light, and flower of courtesy, to which there is always a tacit appeal of pride and reference, as to its inner and imperial court;',
'the parliament of love and chivalry.',
'And this is constituted of those persons in whom heroic dispositions are native; with the love of beauty, the delight in society, and the power to embellish the passing day.',
'If the individuals who compose the purest circles of aristocracy in Europe, the guarded blood of centuries, should pass in review, in such manner as that we could at leisure and critically inspect their behavior, we might find no gentleman and no lady;',
'for although excellent specimens of courtesy and high-breeding would gratify us in the assemblage, in the particulars we should detect offence.',
'Because elegance comes of no breeding, but of birth.',
'There must be romance of character, or the most fastidious exclusion of impertinencies will not avail.',
'It must be genius which takes that direction: it must be not courteous, but courtesy.',
'High behavior is as rare in fiction as it is in fact.',
'Scott is praised for the fidelity with which he painted the demeanor and conversation of the superior classes.',
'Certainly, kings and queens, nobles and great ladies, had some right to complain of the absurdity that had been put in their mouths before the days of Waverley; but neither does Scott’s dialogue bear criticism.',
'His lords brave each other in smart epigramatic speeches, but the dialogue is in costume, and does not please on the second reading: it is not warm with life.',
'In Shakspeare alone the speakers do not strut and bridle, the dialogue is easily great, and he adds to so many titles that of being the best-bred man in England and in Christendom.',
'Once or twice in a lifetime we are permitted to enjoy the charm of noble manners, in the presence of a man or woman who have no bar in their nature, but whose character emanates freely in their word and gesture.',
'A beautiful form is better than a beautiful face; a beautiful behavior is better than a beautiful form: it gives a higher pleasure than statues or pictures; it is the finest of the fine arts.',
'A man is but a little thing in the midst of the objects of nature, yet, by the moral quality radiating from his countenance he may abolish all considerations of magnitude, and in his manners equal the majesty of the world.',
'I have seen an individual whose manners, though wholly within the conventions of elegant society, were never learned there, but were original and commanding and held out protection and prosperity;',
'one who did not need the aid of a court-suit, but carried the holiday in his eye;',
'who exhilarated the fancy by flinging wide the doors of new modes of existence;',
'who shook off the captivity of etiquette, with happy, spirited bearing, good-natured and free as Robin Hood;',
'yet with the port of an emperor, if need be,—calm, serious, and fit to stand the gaze of millions.',
'The open air and the fields, the street and public chambers are the places where Man executes his will; let him yield or divide the sceptre at the door of the house.',
'Woman, with her instinct of behavior, instantly detects in man a love of trifles, any coldness or imbecility, or, in short, any want of that large, flowing, and magnanimous deportment which is indispensable as an exterior in the hall.',
'Our American institutions have been friendly to her, and at this moment I esteem it a chief felicity of this country, that it excels in women.',
'A certain awkward consciousness of inferiority in the men may give rise to the new chivalry in behalf of Woman’s Rights.',
'Certainly let her be as much better placed in the laws and in social forms as the most zealous reformer can ask, but I confide so entirely in her inspiring and musical nature, that I believe only herself can show us how she shall be served.',
'The wonderful generosity of her sentiments raises her at times into heroical and godlike regions, and verifies the pictures of Minerva, Juno, or Polymnia;',
'and by the firmness with which she treads her upward path, she convinces the coarsest calculators that another road exists than that which their feet know.',
'But besides those who make good in our imagination the place of muses and of Delphic Sibyls, are there not women who fill our vase with wine and roses to the brim, so that the wine runs over and fills the house with perfume;',
'who inspire us with courtesy;',
'who unloose our tongues and we speak;',
'who anoint our eyes and we see?',
'We say things we never thought to have said; for once, our walls of habitual reserve vanished and left us at large; we were children playing with children in a wide field of flowers.',
'Steep us, we cried, in these influences, for days, for weeks, and we shall be sunny poets and will write out in many-colored words the romance that you are.',
'Was it Hafiz or Firdousi that said of his Persian Lilla, She was an elemental force, and astonished me by her amount of life, when I saw her day after day radiating, every instant, redundant joy and grace on all around her.',
'She was a solvent powerful to reconcile all heterogeneous persons into one society: like air or water, an element of such a great range of affinities that it combines readily with a thousand substances.',
'Where she is present all others will be more than they are wont.',
'She was a unit and whole, so that whatsoever she did, became her.',
'She had too much sympathy and desire to please, than that you could say her manners were marked with dignity, yet no princess could surpass her clear and erect demeanor on each occasion.',
'She did not study the Persian grammar, nor the books of the seven poets, but all the poems of the seven seemed to be written upon her.',
'For though the bias of her nature was not to thought, but to sympathy, yet was she so perfect in her own nature as to meet intellectual persons by the fulness of her heart, warming them by her sentiments;',
'believing, as she did, that by dealing nobly with all, all would show themselves noble.',
'I know that this Byzantine pile of chivalry or Fashion, which seems so fair and picturesque to those who look at the contemporary facts for science or for entertainment, is not equally pleasant to all spectators.',
'The constitution of our society makes it a giant’s castle to the ambitious youth who have not found their names enrolled in its Golden Book, and whom it has excluded from its coveted honors and privileges.',
'They have yet to learn that its seeming grandeur is shadowy and relative: it is great by their allowance; its proudest gates will fly open at the approach of their courage and virtue.',
'For the present distress, however, of those who are predisposed to suffer from the tyrannies of this caprice, there are easy remedies.',
'To remove your residence a couple of miles, or at most four, will commonly relieve the most extreme susceptibility.',
'For the advantages which fashion values are plants which thrive in very confined localities, in a few streets namely.',
'Out of this precinct they go for nothing; are of no use in the farm, in the forest, in the market, in war, in the nuptial society, in the literary or scientific circle, at sea, in friendship, in the heaven of thought or virtue.',
'But we have lingered long enough in these painted courts.',
'The worth of the thing signified must vindicate our taste for the emblem.',
'Everything that is called fashion and courtesy humbles itself before the cause and fountain of honor, creator of titles and dignities, namely the heart of love.',
'This is the royal blood, this the fire, which, in all countries and contingencies, will work after its kind and conquer and expand all that approaches it.',
'This gives new meanings to every fact.',
'This impoverishes the rich, suffering no grandeur but its own.',
'What is rich?',
'Are you rich enough to help anybody? to succor the unfashionable and the eccentric?',
'rich enough to make the Canadian in his wagon, the itinerant with his consul’s paper which commends him “To the charitable,”',
'the swarthy Italian with his few broken words of English, the lame pauper hunted by overseers from town to town, even the poor insane or besotted wreck of man or woman,',
'feel the noble exception of your presence and your house from the general bleakness and stoniness;',
'to make such feel that they were greeted with a voice which made them both remember and hope?',
'What is vulgar but to refuse the claim on acute and conclusive reasons?',
'What is gentle, but to allow it, and give their heart and yours one holiday from the national caution?',
'Without the rich heart, wealth is an ugly beggar.',
'The king of Schiraz could not afford to be so bountiful as the poor Osman who dwelt at his gate.',
'Osman had a humanity so broad and deep that although his speech was so bold and free with the Koran as to disgust all the dervishes, yet was there never a poor outcast, eccentric, or insane man,',
'some fool who had cut off his beard, or who had been mutilated under a vow, or had a pet madness in his brain, but fled at once to him;',
'that great heart lay there so sunny and hospitable in the centre of the country, that it seemed as if the instinct of all sufferers drew them to his side.',
'And the madness which he harbored he did not share.',
'Is not this to be rich? this only to be rightly rich?',
'But I shall hear without pain that I play the courtier very ill, and talk of that which I do not well understand.',
'It is easy to see, that what is called by distinction society and fashion has good laws as well as bad, has much that is necessary, and much that is absurd.',
'Too good for banning, and too bad for blessing, it reminds us of a tradition of the pagan mythology, in any attempt to settle its character.',
'‘I overheard Jove, one day,’ said Silenus, ‘talking of destroying the earth; he said it had failed; they were all rogues and vixens, who went from bad to worse, as fast as the days succeeded each other.',
'Minerva said she hoped not;',
'they were only ridiculous little creatures, with this odd circumstance, that they had a blur, or indeterminate aspect, seen far or seen near;',
'if you called them bad, they would appear so;',
'if you called them good, they would appear so;',
'and there was no one person or action among them, which would not puzzle her owl, much more all Olympus, to know whether it was fundamentally bad or good.’',
'V: GIFTS.',
'Gifts of one who loved me,—',
'‘Twas high time they came;',
'When he ceased to love me,',
'Time they stopped for shame.',
'IT is said that the world is in a state of bankruptcy; that the world owes the world more than the world can pay, and ought to go into chancery and be sold.',
'I do not think this general insolvency, which involves in some sort all the population, to be the reason of the difficulty experienced at Christmas and New Year and other times, in bestowing gifts; since it is always so pleasant to be generous, though very vexatious to pay debts.',
'But the impediment lies in the choosing.',
'If at any time it comes into my head that a present is due from me to somebody, I am puzzled what to give, until the opportunity is gone.',
'Flowers and fruits are always fit presents; flowers, because they are a proud assertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the utilities of the world.',
'These gay natures contrast with the somewhat stern countenance of ordinary nature: they are like music heard out of a work-house.',
'Nature does not cocker us; we are children, not pets; she is not fond; everything is dealt to us without fear or favor, after severe universal laws.',
'Yet these delicate flowers look like the frolic and interference of love and beauty.',
'Men use to tell us that we love flattery even though we are not deceived by it, because it shows that we are of importance enough to be courted.',
'Something like that pleasure, the flowers give us: what am I to whom these sweet hints are addressed?',
'Fruits are acceptable gifts, because they are the flower of commodities, and admit of fantastic values being attached to them.',
'If a man should send to me to come a hundred miles to visit him and should set before me a basket of fine summer-fruit, I should think there was some proportion between the labor and the reward.',
'For common gifts, necessity makes pertinences and beauty every day, and one is glad when an imperative leaves him no option; since if the man at the door have no shoes, you have not to consider whether you could procure him a paint-box.',
'And as it is always pleasing to see a man eat bread, or drink water, in the house or out of doors, so it is always a great satisfaction to supply these first wants.',
'Necessity does everything well.',
'In our condition of universal dependence it seems heroic to let the petitioner be the judge of his necessity, and to give all that is asked, though at great inconvenience.',
'If it be a fantastic desire, it is better to leave to others the office of punishing him.',
'I can think of many parts I should prefer playing to that of the Furies.',
'Next to things of necessity, the rule for a gift, which one of my friends prescribed, is that we might convey to some person that which properly belonged to his character, and was easily associated with him in thought.',
'But our tokens of compliment and love are for the most part barbarous.',
'Rings and other jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts.',
'The only gift is a portion of thyself.',
'Thou must bleed for me.',
'Therefore the poet brings his poem; the shepherd, his lamb; the farmer, corn; the miner, a gem; the sailor, coral and shells; the painter, his picture; the girl, a handkerchief of her own sewing.',
'This is right and pleasing, for it restores society in so far to its primary basis, when a man’s biography is conveyed in his gift, and every man’s wealth is an index of his merit.',
'But it is a cold lifeless business when you go to the shops to buy me something which does not represent your life and talent, but a goldsmith’s.',
'This is fit for kings, and rich men who represent kings, and a false state of property, to make presents of gold and silver stuffs, as a kind of symbolical sin-offering, or payment of black-mail.',
'The law of benefits is a difficult channel, which requires careful sailing, or rude boats.',
'It is not the office of a man to receive gifts.',
'How dare you give them?',
'We wish to be self-sustained.',
'We do not quite forgive a giver.',
'The hand that feeds us is in some danger of being bitten.',
'We can receive anything from love, for that is a way of receiving it from ourselves; but not from any one who assumes to bestow.',
'We sometimes hate the meat which we eat, because there seems something of degrading dependence in living by it:—',
'“Brother, if Jove to thee a present make,',
'Take heed that from his hands thou nothing take.”',
'We ask the whole.',
'Nothing less will content us.',
'We arraign society if it do not give us, besides earth and fire and water, opportunity, love, reverence, and objects of veneration.',
'He is a good man who can receive a gift well.',
'We are either glad or sorry at a gift, and both emotions are unbecoming.',
'Some violence I think is done, some degradation borne, when I rejoice or grieve at a gift.',
'I am sorry when my independence is invaded, or when a gift comes from such as do not know my spirit, and so the act is not supported; and if the gift pleases me overmuch, then I should be ashamed that the donor should read my heart, and see that I love his commodity, and not him.',
'The gift, to be true, must be the flowing of the giver unto me, correspondent to my flowing unto him.',
'When the waters are at level, then my goods pass to him, and his to me.',
'All his are mine, all mine his.',
'I say to him, How can you give me this pot of oil or this flagon of wine when all your oil and wine is mine, which belief of mine this gift seems to deny?',
'Hence the fitness of beautiful, not useful things, for gifts.',
'This giving is flat usurpation, and therefore when the beneficiary is ungrateful, as all beneficiaries hate all Timons, not at all considering the value of the gift but looking back to the greater store it was taken from,—',
'I rather sympathize with the beneficiary than with the anger of my lord Timon.',
'For the expectation of gratitude is mean, and is continually punished by the total insensibility of the obliged person.',
'It is a great happiness to get off without injury and heart-burning from one who has had the ill-luck to be served by you.',
'It is a very onerous business, this of being served, and the debtor naturally wishes to give you a slap.',
'A golden text for these gentlemen is that which I so admire in the Buddhist, who never thanks, and who says, “Do not flatter your benefactors.”',
'The reason of these discords I conceive to be that there is no commensurability between a man and any gift.',
'You cannot give anything to a magnanimous person.',
'After you have served him he at once puts you in debt by his magnanimity.',
'The service a man renders his friend is trivial and selfish compared with the service he knows his friend stood in readiness to yield him, alike before he had begun to serve his friend, and now also.',
'Compared with that good-will I bear my friend, the benefit it is in my power to render him seems small.',
'Besides, our action on each other, good as well as evil, is so incidental and at random that we can seldom hear the acknowledgments of any person who would thank us for a benefit, without some shame and humiliation.',
'We can rarely strike a direct stroke, but must be content with an oblique one; we seldom have the satisfaction of yielding a direct benefit which is directly received.',
'But rectitude scatters favors on every side without knowing it, and receives with wonder the thanks of all people.',
'I fear to breathe any treason against the majesty of love, which is the genius and god of gifts, and to whom we must not affect to prescribe.',
'Let him give kingdoms or flower-leaves indifferently.',
'There are persons from whom we always expect fairy-tokens; let us not cease to expect them.',
'This is prerogative, and not to be limited by our municipal rules.',
'For the rest, I like to see that we cannot be bought and sold.',
'The best of hospitality and of generosity is also not in the will, but in fate.',
'I find that I am not much to you; you do not need me; you do not feel me; then am I thrust out of doors, though you proffer me house and lands.',
'No services are of any value, but only likeness.',
'When I have attempted to join myself to others by services, it proved an intellectual trick,—no more.',
'They eat your service like apples, and leave you out.',
'But love them, and they feel you and delight in you all the time.',
'VI: NATURE.',
'The rounded world is fair to see,',
'Nine times folded in mystery:',
'Though baffled seers cannot impart',
'The secret of its laboring heart,',
'Throb thine with Nature’s throbbing breast,',
'And all is clear from east to west.',
'Spirit that lurks each form within',
'Beckons to spirit of its kin;',
'Self-kindled every atom glows,',
'And hints the future which it owes.',
'THERE are days which occur in this climate, at almost any season of the year, wherein the world reaches its perfection;',
'when the air, the heavenly bodies and the earth, make a harmony, as if nature would indulge her offspring;',
'when, in these bleak upper sides of the planet, nothing is to desire that we have heard of the happiest latitudes, and we bask in the shining hours of Florida and Cuba;',
'when everything that has life gives sign of satisfaction, and the cattle that lie on the ground seem to have great and tranquil thoughts.',
'These halcyons may be looked for with a little more assurance in that pure October weather which we distinguish by the name of the Indian summer.',
'The day, immeasurably long, sleeps over the broad hills and warm wide fields.',
'To have lived through all its sunny hours, seems longevity enough.',
'The solitary places do not seem quite lonely.',
'At the gates of the forest, the surprised man of the world is forced to leave his city estimates of great and small, wise and foolish.',
'The knapsack of custom falls off his back with the first step he makes into these precincts.',
'Here is sanctity which shames our religions, and reality which discredits our heroes.',
'Here we find Nature to be the circumstance which dwarfs every other circumstance, and judges like a god all men that come to her.',
'We have crept out of our close and crowded houses into the night and morning, and we see what majestic beauties daily wrap us in their bosom.',
'How willingly we would escape the barriers which render them comparatively impotent, escape the sophistication and second thought, and suffer nature to intrance us.',
'The tempered light of the woods is like a perpetual morning, and is stimulating and heroic.',
'The anciently reported spells of these places creep on us.',
'The stems of pines, hemlocks, and oaks almost gleam like iron on the excited eye.',
'The incommunicable trees begin to persuade us to live with them, and quit our life of solemn trifles.',
'Here no history, or church, or state, is interpolated on the divine sky and the immortal year.',
'How easily we might walk onward into the opening landscape, absorbed by new pictures and by thoughts fast succeeding each other,',
'until by degrees the recollection of home was crowded out of the mind, all memory obliterated by the tyranny of the present, and we were led in triumph by nature.',
'These enchantments are medicinal, they sober and heal us.',
'These are plain pleasures, kindly and native to us.',
'We come to our own, and make friends with matter, which the ambitious chatter of the schools would persuade us to despise.',
'We never can part with it; the mind loves its old home: as water to our thirst, so is the rock, the ground, to our eyes and hands and feet.',
'It is firm water; it is cold flame; what health, what affinity!',
'Ever an old friend, ever like a dear friend and brother when we chat affectedly with strangers, comes in this honest face, and takes a grave liberty with us, and shames us out of our nonsense.',
'Cities give not the human senses room enough.',
'We go out daily and nightly to feed the eyes on the horizon, and require so much scope, just as we need water for our bath.',
'There are all degrees of natural influence, from these quarantine powers of nature, up to her dearest and gravest ministrations to the imagination and the soul.',
'There is the bucket of cold water from the spring, the wood-fire to which the chilled traveller rushes for safety,—and there is the sublime moral of autumn and of noon.',
'We nestle in nature, and draw our living as parasites from her roots and grains, and we receive glances from the heavenly bodies, which call us to solitude and foretell the remotest future.',
'The blue zenith is the point in which romance and reality meet.',
'I think if we should be rapt away into all that we dream of heaven, and should converse with Gabriel and Uriel, the upper sky would be all that would remain of our furniture.',
'It seems as if the day was not wholly profane in which we have given heed to some natural object.',
'The fall of snowflakes in a still air, preserving to each crystal its perfect form;',
'the blowing of sleet over a wide sheet of water, and over plains;',
'the waving ryefield;',
'the mimic waving of acres of houstonia, whose innumerable florets whiten and ripple before the eye;',
'the reflections of trees and flowers in glassy lakes;',
'the musical steaming odorous south wind, which converts all trees to windharps;',
'the crackling and spurting of hemlock in the flames, or of pine logs, which yield glory to the walls and faces in the sittingroom,—these are the music and pictures of the most ancient religion.',
'My house stands in low land, with limited outlook, and on the skirt of the village.',
'But I go with my friend to the shore of our little river, and with one stroke of the paddle I leave the village politics and personalities, yes, and the world of villages and personalities behind, and pass into a delicate realm of sunset and moonlight,',
'too bright almost for spotted man to enter without novitiate and probation.',
'We penetrate bodily this incredible beauty; we dip our hands in this painted element; our eyes are bathed in these lights and forms.',
'A holiday, a villeggiatura, a royal revel, the proudest, most heart-rejoicing festival that valor and beauty, power and taste, ever decked and enjoyed, establishes itself on the instant.',
'These sunset clouds, these delicately emerging stars, with their private and ineffable glances, signify it and proffer it.',
'I am taught the poorness of our invention, the ugliness of towns and palaces.',
'Art and luxury have early learned that they must work as enhancement and sequel to this original beauty.',
'I am overinstructed for my return.',
'Henceforth I shall be hard to please.',
'I cannot go back to toys.',
'I am grown expensive and sophisticated.',
'I can no longer live without elegance, but a countryman shall be my master of revels.',
'He who knows the most; he who knows what sweets and virtues are in the ground, the waters, the plants, the heavens, and how to come at these enchantments,—is the rich and royal man.',
'Only as far as the masters of the world have called in nature to their aid, can they reach the height of magnificence.',
'This is the meaning of their hanging-gardens, villas, garden-houses, islands, parks and preserves, to back their faulty personality with these strong accessories.',
'I do not wonder that the landed interest should be invincible in the State with these dangerous auxiliaries.',
'These bribe and invite; not kings, not palaces, not men, not women, but these tender and poetic stars, eloquent of secret promises.',
'We heard what the rich man said, we knew of his villa, his grove, his wine and his company, but the provocation and point of the invitation came out of these beguiling stars.',
'In their soft glances I see what men strove to realize in some Versailles, or Paphos, or Ctesiphon.',
'Indeed, it is the magical lights of the horizon and the blue sky for the background which save all our works of art, which were otherwise bawbles.',
'When the rich tax the poor with servility and obsequiousness, they should consider the effect of men reputed to be the possessors of nature, on imaginative minds.',
'Ah! if the rich were rich as the poor fancy riches!',
'A boy hears a military band play on the field at night, and he has kings and queens and famous chivalry palpably before him.',
'He hears the echoes of a horn in a hill country, in the Notch Mountains, for example, which converts the mountains into an Aeolian harp,—and this supernatural tiralira restores to him the Dorian mythology, Apollo, Diana, and all divine hunters and huntresses.',
'Can a musical note be so lofty, so haughtily beautiful!',
'To the poor young poet, thus fabulous is his picture of society; he is loyal; he respects the rich; they are rich for the sake of his imagination; how poor his fancy would be, if they were not rich!',
'That they have some high-fenced grove which they call a park;',
'that they live in larger and better-garnished saloons than he has visited, and go in coaches, keeping only the society of the elegant, to watering-places and to distant cities,—',
'these make the groundwork from which he has delineated estates of romance, compared with which their actual possessions are shanties and paddocks.',
'The muse herself betrays her son, and enhances the gifts of wealth and well-born beauty by a radiation out of the air, and clouds, and forests that skirt the road,—',
'a certain haughty favor, as if from patrician genii to patricians, a kind of aristocracy in nature, a prince of the power of the air.',
'The moral sensibility which makes Edens and Tempes so easily, may not be always found, but the material landscape is never far off.',
'We can find these enchantments without visiting the Como Lake, or the Madeira Islands.',
'We exaggerate the praises of local scenery.',
'In every landscape the point of astonishment is the meeting of the sky and the earth, and that is seen from the first hillock as well as from the top of the Alleghanies.',
'The stars at night stoop down over the brownest, homeliest common with all the spiritual magnificence which they shed on the Campagna, or on the marble deserts of Egypt.',
'The uprolled clouds and the colors of morning and evening will transfigure maples and alders.',
'The difference between landscape and landscape is small, but there is great difference in the beholders.',
'There is nothing so wonderful in any particular landscape as the necessity of being beautiful under which every landscape lies.',
'Nature cannot be surprised in undress.',
'Beauty breaks in everywhere.',
'But it is very easy to outrun the sympathy of readers on this topic, which schoolmen called natura naturata, or nature passive.',
'One can hardly speak directly of it without excess.',
'It is as easy to broach in mixed companies what is called “the subject of religion.”',
'A susceptible person does not like to indulge his tastes in this kind without the apology of some trivial necessity: he goes to see a wood-lot, or to look at the crops, or to fetch a plant or a mineral from a remote locality, or he carries a fowling-piece or a fishing-rod.',
'I suppose this shame must have a good reason.',
'A dilettantism in nature is barren and unworthy.',
'The fop of fields is no better than his brother of Broadway.',
'Men are naturally hunters and inquisitive of wood-craft, and I suppose that such a gazetteer as wood-cutters and Indians should furnish facts for, would take place in the most sumptuous drawing-rooms of all the “Wreaths” and “Flora’s chaplets” of the bookshops;',
'yet ordinarily, whether we are too clumsy for so subtle a topic, or from whatever cause, as soon as men begin to write on nature, they fall into euphuism.',
'Frivolity is a most unfit tribute to Pan, who ought to be represented in the mythology as the most continent of gods.',
'I would not be frivolous before the admirable reserve and prudence of time, yet I cannot renounce the right of returning often to this old topic.',
'The multitude of false churches accredits the true religion.',
'Literature, poetry, science are the homage of man to this unfathomed secret, concerning which no sane man can affect an indifference or incuriosity.',
'Nature is loved by what is best in us.',
'It is loved as the city of God, although, or rather because there is no citizen.',
'The sunset is unlike anything that is underneath it: it wants men.',
'And the beauty of nature must always seem unreal and mocking, until the landscape has human figures that are as good as itself.',
'If there were good men, there would never be this rapture in nature.',
'If the king is in the palace, nobody looks at the walls.',
'It is when he is gone, and the house is filled with grooms and gazers, that we turn from the people to find relief in the majestic men that are suggested by the pictures and the architecture.',
'The critics who complain of the sickly separation of the beauty of nature from the thing to be done, must consider that our hunting of the picturesque is inseparable from our protest against false society.',
'Man is fallen; nature is erect, and serves as a differential thermometer, detecting the presence or absence of the divine sentiment in man.',
'By fault of our dulness and selfishness we are looking up to nature, but when we are convalescent, nature will look up to us.',
'We see the foaming brook with compunction: if our own life flowed with the right energy, we should shame the brook.',
'The stream of zeal sparkles with real fire, and not with reflex rays of sun and moon.',
'Nature may be as selfishly studied as trade.',
'Astronomy to the selfish becomes astrology; psychology, mesmerism (with intent to show where our spoons are gone); and anatomy and physiology become phrenology and palmistry.',
'But taking timely warning, and leaving many things unsaid on this topic, let us not longer omit our homage to the Efficient Nature, natura naturans, the quick cause before which all forms flee as the driven snows;',
'itself secret, its works driven before it in flocks and multitudes, (as the ancient represented nature by Proteus, a shepherd,) and in undescribable variety.',
'It publishes itself in creatures, reaching from particles and spiculae through transformation on transformation to the highest symmetries, arriving at consummate results without a shock or a leap.',
'A little heat, that is a little motion, is all that differences the bald, dazzling white and deadly cold poles of the earth from the prolific tropical climates.',
'All changes pass without violence, by reason of the two cardinal conditions of boundless space and boundless time.',
'Geology has initiated us into the secularity of nature, and taught us to disuse our dame-school measures, and exchange our Mosaic and Ptolemaic schemes for her large style.',
'We knew nothing rightly, for want of perspective.',
'Now we learn what patient periods must round themselves before the rock is formed; then before the rock is broken, and the first lichen race has disintegrated the thinnest external plate into soil, and opened the door for the remote Flora, Fauna, Ceres, and Pomona to come in.',
'How far off yet is the trilobite! how far the quadruped! how inconceivably remote is man!',
'All duly arrive, and then race after race of men.',
'It is a long way from granite to the oyster; farther yet to Plato and the preaching of the immortality of the soul.',
'Yet all must come, as surely as the first atom has two sides.',
'Motion or change and identity or rest are the first and second secrets of nature:—Motion and Rest.',
'The whole code of her laws may be written on the thumbnail, or the signet of a ring.',
'The whirling bubble on the surface of a brook admits us to the secret of the mechanics of the sky.',
'Every shell on the beach is a key to it.',
'A little water made to rotate in a cup explains the formation of the simpler shells;',
'the addition of matter from year to year, arrives at last at the most complex forms;',
'and yet so poor is nature with all her craft, that from the beginning to the end of the universe she has but one stuff,—but one stuff with its two ends, to serve up all her dream-like variety.',
'Compound it how she will, star, sand, fire, water, tree, man, it is still one stuff, and betrays the same properties.',
'Nature is always consistent, though she feigns to contravene her own laws.',
'She keeps her laws, and seems to transcend them.',
'She arms and equips an animal to find its place and living in the earth, and at the same time she arms and equips another animal to destroy it.',
'Space exists to divide creatures; but by clothing the sides of a bird with a few feathers she gives him a petty omnipresence.',
'The direction is forever onward, but the artist still goes back for materials and begins again with the first elements on the most advanced stage: otherwise all goes to ruin.',
'If we look at her work, we seem to catch a glance of a system in transition.',
'Plants are the young of the world, vessels of health and vigor; but they grope ever upward towards consciousness; the trees are imperfect men, and seem to bemoan their imprisonment, rooted in the ground.',
'The animal is the novice and probationer of a more advanced order.',
'The men, though young, having tasted the first drop from the cup of thought, are already dissipated: the maples and ferns are still uncorrupt; yet no doubt when they come to consciousness they too will curse and swear.',
'Flowers so strictly belong to youth that we adult men soon come to feel that their beautiful generations concern not us: we have had our day; now let the children have theirs.',
'The flowers jilt us, and we are old bachelors with our ridiculous tenderness.',
'Things are so strictly related, that according to the skill of the eye, from any one object the parts and properties of any other may be predicted.',
'If we had eyes to see it, a bit of stone from the city wall would certify us of the necessity that man must exist, as readily as the city.',
'That identity makes us all one, and reduces to nothing great intervals on our customary scale.',
'We talk of deviations from natural life, as if artificial life were not also natural.',
'The smoothest curled courtier in the boudoirs of a palace has an animal nature, rude and aboriginal as a white bear, omnipotent to its own ends, and is directly related, there amid essences and billetsdoux, to Himmaleh mountain-chains and the axis of the globe.',
'If we consider how much we are nature’s, we need not be superstitious about towns, as if that terrific or benefic force did not find us there also, and fashion cities.',
'Nature, who made the mason, made the house.',
'We may easily hear too much of rural influences.',
'The cool disengaged air of natural objects makes them enviable to us, chafed and irritable creatures with red faces, and we think we shall be as grand as they if we camp out and eat roots;',
'but let us be men instead of woodchucks and the oak and the elm shall gladly serve us, though we sit in chairs of ivory on carpets of silk.',
'This guiding identity runs through all the surprises and contrasts of the piece, and characterizes every law.',
'Man carries the world in his head, the whole astronomy and chemistry suspended in a thought.',
'Because the history of nature is charactered in his brain, therefore is he the prophet and discoverer of her secrets.',
'Every known fact in natural science was divined by the presentiment of somebody, before it was actually verified.',
'A man does not tie his shoe without recognizing laws which bind the farthest regions of nature: moon, plant, gas, crystal, are concrete geometry and numbers.',
'Common sense knows its own, and recognizes the fact at first sight in chemical experiment.',
'The common sense of Franklin, Dalton, Davy and Black, is the same common sense which made the arrangements which now it discovers.',
'If the identity expresses organized rest, the counter action runs also into organization.',
'The astronomers said, ‘Give us matter and a little motion and we will construct the universe.',
'It is not enough that we should have matter, we must also have a single impulse, one shove to launch the mass and generate the harmony of the centrifugal and centripetal forces.',
'Once heave the ball from the hand, and we can show how all this mighty order grew.’—‘A very unreasonable postulate,’ said the metaphysicians, ‘and a plain begging of the question.',
'Could you not prevail to know the genesis of projection, as well as the continuation of it?’',
'Nature, meanwhile, had not waited for the discussion, but, right or wrong, bestowed the impulse, and the balls rolled.',
'It was no great affair, a mere push, but the astronomers were right in making much of it, for there is no end to the consequences of the act.',
'That famous aboriginal push propagates itself through all the balls of the system, and through every atom of every ball; through all the races of creatures, and through the history and performances of every individual.',
'Exaggeration is in the course of things.',
'Nature sends no creature, no man into the world without adding a small excess of his proper quality.',
'Given the planet, it is still necessary to add the impulse; so to every creature nature added a little violence of direction in its proper path, a shove to put it on its way; in every instance a slight generosity, a drop too much.',
'Without electricity the air would rot, and without this violence of direction which men and women have, without a spice of bigot and fanatic, no excitement, no efficiency.',
'We aim above the mark to hit the mark.',
'Every act hath some falsehood of exaggeration in it.',
'And when now and then comes along some sad, sharp-eyed man, who sees how paltry a game is played, and refuses to play, but blabs the secret;—how then?',
'Is the bird flown?',
'O no, the wary Nature sends a new troop of fairer forms, of lordlier youths, with a little more excess of direction to hold them fast to their several aim;',
'makes them a little wrongheaded in that direction in which they are rightest, and on goes the game again with new whirl, for a generation or two more.',
'The child with his sweet pranks, the fool of his senses, commanded by every sight and sound, without any power to compare and rank his sensations, abandoned to a whistle or a painted chip,',
'to a lead dragoon or a gingerbread-dog, individualizing everything, generalizing nothing, delighted with every new thing, lies down at night overpowered by the fatigue which this day of continual pretty madness has incurred.',
'But Nature has answered her purpose with the curly, dimpled lunatic.',
'She has tasked every faculty, and has secured the symmetrical growth of the bodily frame by all these attitudes and exertions,—an end of the first importance, which could not be trusted to any care less perfect than her own.',
'This glitter, this opaline lustre plays round the top of every toy to his eye to insure his fidelity, and he is deceived to his good.',
'We are made alive and kept alive by the same arts.',
'Let the stoics say what they please, we do not eat for the good of living, but because the meat is savory and the appetite is keen.',
'The vegetable life does not content itself with casting from the flower or the tree a single seed, but it fills the air and earth with a prodigality of seeds, that, if thousands perish, thousands may plant themselves;',
'that hundreds may come up, that tens may live to maturity;',
'that at least one may replace the parent.',
'All things betray the same calculated profusion.',
'The excess of fear with which the animal frame is hedged round, shrinking from cold, starting at sight of a snake, or at a sudden noise, protects us, through a multitude of groundless alarms, from some one real danger at last.',
'The lover seeks in marriage his private felicity and perfection, with no prospective end; and nature hides in his happiness her own end, namely, progeny, or the perpetuity of the race.',
'But the craft with which the world is made, runs also into the mind and character of men.',
'No man is quite sane; each has a vein of folly in his composition, a slight determination of blood to the head, to make sure of holding him hard to some one point which nature had taken to heart.',
'Great causes are never tried on their merits; but the cause is reduced to particulars to suit the size of the partisans, and the contention is ever hottest on minor matters.',
'Not less remarkable is the overfaith of each man in the importance of what he has to do or say.',
'The poet, the prophet, has a higher value for what he utters than any hearer, and therefore it gets spoken.',
'The strong, self-complacent Luther declares with an emphasis not to be mistaken, that “God himself cannot do without wise men.”',
'Jacob Behmen and George Fox betray their egotism in the pertinacity of their controversial tracts, and James Naylor once suffered himself to be worshipped as the Christ.',
'Each prophet comes presently to identify himself with his thought, and to esteem his hat and shoes sacred.',
'However this may discredit such persons with the judicious, it helps them with the people, as it gives heat, pungency, and publicity to their words.',
'A similar experience is not infrequent in private life.',
'Each young and ardent person writes a diary, in which, when the hours of prayer and penitence arrive, he inscribes his soul.',
'The pages thus written are to him burning and fragrant; he reads them on his knees by midnight and by the morning star; he wets them with his tears; they are sacred; too good for the world, and hardly yet to be shown to the dearest friend.',
'This is the man-child that is born to the soul, and her life still circulates in the babe.',
'The umbilical cord has not yet been cut.',
'After some time has elapsed, he begins to wish to admit his friend to this hallowed experience, and with hesitation, yet with firmness, exposes the pages to his eye.',
'Will they not burn his eyes?',
'The friend coldly turns them over, and passes from the writing to conversation, with easy transition, which strikes the other party with astonishment and vexation.',
'He cannot suspect the writing itself.',
'Days and nights of fervid life, of communion with angels of darkness and of light have engraved their shadowy characters on that tear-stained book.',
'He suspects the intelligence or the heart of his friend.',
'Is there then no friend?',
'He cannot yet credit that one may have impressive experience and yet may not know how to put his private fact into literature;',
'and perhaps the discovery that wisdom has other tongues and ministers than we, that though we should hold our peace the truth would not the less be spoken, might check injuriously the flames of our zeal.',
'A man can only speak so long as he does not feel his speech to be partial and inadequate.',
'It is partial, but he does not see it to be so whilst he utters it.',
'As soon as he is released from the instinctive and particular and sees its partiality, he shuts his mouth in disgust.',
'For no man can write anything who does not think that what he writes is for the time the history of the world; or do anything well who does not esteem his work to be of importance.',
'My work may be of none, but I must not think it of none, or I shall not do it with impunity.',
'In like manner, there is throughout nature something mocking, something that leads us on and on, but arrives nowhere; keeps no faith with us.',
'All promise outruns the performance.',
'We live in a system of approximations.',
'Every end is prospective of some other end, which is also temporary; a round and final success nowhere.',
'We are encamped in nature, not domesticated.',
'Hunger and thirst lead us on to eat and to drink; but bread and wine, mix and cook them how you will, leave us hungry and thirsty, after the stomach is full.',
'It is the same with all our arts and performances.',
'Our music, our poetry, our language itself are not satisfactions, but suggestions.',
'The hunger for wealth, which reduces the planet to a garden, fools the eager pursuer.',
'What is the end sought?',
'Plainly to secure the ends of good sense and beauty, from the intrusion of deformity or vulgarity of any kind.',
'But what an operose method!',
'What a train of means to secure a little conversation!',
'This palace of brick and stone, these servants, this kitchen, these stables, horses and equipage, this bank-stock and file of mortgages; trade to all the world, country-house and cottage by the waterside, all for a little conversation, high, clear, and spiritual!',
'Could it not be had as well by beggars on the highway?',
'No, all these things came from successive efforts of these beggars to remove friction from the wheels of life, and give opportunity.',
'Conversation, character, were the avowed ends; wealth was good as it appeased the animal cravings, cured the smoky chimney, silenced the creaking door, brought friends together in a warm and quiet room, and kept the children and the dinner-table in a different apartment.',
'Thought, virtue, beauty, were the ends; but it was known that men of thought and virtue sometimes had the headache, or wet feet, or could lose good time whilst the room was getting warm in winter days.',
'Unluckily, in the exertions necessary to remove these inconveniences, the main attention has been diverted to this object; the old aims have been lost sight of, and to remove friction has come to be the end.',
'That is the ridicule of rich men, and Boston, London, Vienna, and now the governments generally of the world are cities and governments of the rich;',
'and the masses are not men, but poor men, that is, men who would be rich;',
'this is the ridicule of the class, that they arrive with pains and sweat and fury nowhere;',
'when all is done, it is for nothing.',
'They are like one who has interrupted the conversation of a company to make his speech, and now has forgotten what he went to say.',
'The appearance strikes the eye everywhere of an aimless society, of aimless nations.',
'Were the ends of nature so great and cogent as to exact this immense sacrifice of men?',
'Quite analogous to the deceits in life, there is, as might be expected, a similar effect on the eye from the face of external nature.',
'There is in woods and waters a certain enticement and flattery, together with a failure to yield a present satisfaction.',
'This disappointment is felt in every landscape.',
'I have seen the softness and beauty of the summer clouds floating feathery overhead, enjoying,',
'as it seemed, their height and privilege of motion, whilst yet they appeared not so much the drapery of this place and hour,',
'as forelooking to some pavilions and gardens of festivity beyond.',
'It is an odd jealousy, but the poet finds himself not near enough to his object.',
'The pine-tree, the river, the bank of flowers before him, does not seem to be nature.',
'Nature is still elsewhere.',
'This or this is but outskirt and far-off reflection and echo of the triumph that has passed by and is now at its glancing splendor and heyday, perchance in the neighboring fields, or, if you stand in the field, then in the adjacent woods.',
'The present object shall give you this sense of stillness that follows a pageant which has just gone by.',
'What splendid distance, what recesses of ineffable pomp and loveliness in the sunset!',
'But who can go where they are, or lay his hand or plant his foot thereon?',
'Off they fall from the round world forever and ever.',
'It is the same among the men and women as among the silent trees; always a referred existence, an absence, never a presence and satisfaction.',
'Is it that beauty can never be grasped? in persons and in landscape is equally inaccessible?',
'The accepted and betrothed lover has lost the wildest charm of his maiden in her acceptance of him.',
'She was heaven whilst he pursued her as a star: she cannot be heaven if she stoops to such a one as he.',
'What shall we say of this omnipresent appearance of that first projectile impulse, of this flattery and balking of so many well-meaning creatures?',
'Must we not suppose somewhere in the universe a slight treachery and derision?',
'Are we not engaged to a serious resentment of this use that is made of us?',
'Are we tickled trout, and fools of nature?',
'One look at the face of heaven and earth lays all petulance at rest, and soothes us to wiser convictions.',
'To the intelligent, nature converts itself into a vast promise, and will not be rashly explained.',
'Her secret is untold.',
'Many and many an Oedipus arrives; he has the whole mystery teeming in his brain.',
'Alas! the same sorcery has spoiled his skill; no syllable can he shape on his lips.',
'Her mighty orbit vaults like the fresh rainbow into the deep, but no archangel’s wing was yet strong enough to follow it and report of the return of the curve.',
'But it also appears that our actions are seconded and disposed to greater conclusions than we designed.',
'We are escorted on every hand through life by spiritual agents, and a beneficent purpose lies in wait for us.',
'We cannot bandy words with Nature, or deal with her as we deal with persons.',
'If we measure our individual forces against hers we may easily feel as if we were the sport of an insuperable destiny.',
'But if,',
'instead of identifying ourselves with the work, we feel that the soul of the workman streams through us, we shall find the peace of the morning dwelling first in our hearts,',
'and the fathomless powers of gravity and chemistry,',
'and, over them, of life, preexisting within us in their highest form.',
'The uneasiness which the thought of our helplessness in the chain of causes occasions us, results from looking too much at one condition of nature, namely, Motion.',
'But the drag is never taken from the wheel.',
'Wherever the impulse exceeds, the Rest or Identity insinuates its compensation.',
'All over the wide fields of earth grows the prunella or self-heal.',
'After every foolish day we sleep off the fumes and furies of its hours; and though we are always engaged with particulars, and often enslaved to them, we bring with us to every experiment the innate universal laws.',
'These, while they exist in the mind as ideas, stand around us in nature forever embodied, a present sanity to expose and cure the insanity of men.',
'Our servitude to particulars betrays into a hundred foolish expectations.',
'We anticipate a new era from the invention of a locomotive, or a balloon; the new engine brings with it the old checks.',
'They say that by electro-magnetism your salad shall be grown from the seed whilst your fowl is roasting for dinner;',
'it is a symbol of our modern aims and endeavors, of our condensation and acceleration of objects;—but nothing is gained;',
'nature cannot be cheated;',
'man’s life is but seventy salads long, grow they swift or grow they slow.',
'In these checks and impossibilities however we find our advantage, not less than in the impulses.',
'Let the victory fall where it will, we are on that side.',
'And the knowledge that we traverse the whole scale of being, from the centre to the poles of nature, and have some stake in every possibility, lends that sublime lustre to death,',
'which philosophy and religion have too outwardly and literally striven to express in the popular doctrine of the immortality of the soul.',
'The reality is more excellent than the report.',
'Here is no ruin, no discontinuity, no spent ball.',
'The divine circulations never rest nor linger.',
'Nature is the incarnation of a thought, and turns to a thought again, as ice becomes water and gas.',
'The world is mind precipitated, and the volatile essence is forever escaping again into the state of free thought.',
'Hence the virtue and pungency of the influence on the mind of natural objects, whether inorganic or organized.',
'Man imprisoned, man crystallized, man vegetative, speaks to man impersonated.',
'That power which does not respect quantity, which makes the whole and the particle its equal channel, delegates its smile to the morning, and distils its essence into every drop of rain.',
'Every moment instructs, and every object: for wisdom is infused into every form.',
'It has been poured into us as blood; it convulsed us as pain; it slid into us as pleasure; it enveloped us in dull, melancholy days, or in days of cheerful labor; we did not guess its essence until after a long time.',
'VII: POLITICS.',
'Gold and iron are good',
'To buy iron and gold;',
'All earth’s fleece and food',
'For their like are sold.',
'Boded Merlin wise,',
'Proved Napoleon great,—',
'Nor kind nor coinage buys',
'Aught above its rate.',
'Fear, Craft, and Avarice',
'Cannot rear a State.',
'Out of dust to build',
'What is more than dust,—',
'Walls Amphion piled',
'Phoebus stablish must.',
'When the Muses nine',
'With the Virtues meet,',
'Find to their design',
'An Atlantic seat,',
'By green orchard boughs',
'Fended from the heat,',
'Where the statesman ploughs',
'Furrow for the wheat;',
'When the Church is social worth,',
'When the state-house is the hearth,',
'Then the perfect State is come,',
'The republican at home.',
'In dealing with the State we ought to remember that its institution are not aboriginal, though they existed before we were born;',
'that they are not superior to the citizen;',
'that every one of them was once the act of a single man;',
'every law and usage was a man’s expedient to meet a particular case;',
'that they all are imitable, all alterable;',
'we may make as good, we may make better.',
'Society is an illusion to the young citizen.',
'It lies before him in rigid repose, with certain names, men and institutions rooted like oak-trees to the centre, round which all arrange themselves the best they can.',
'But the old statesman knows that society is fluid;',
'there are no such roots and centres, but any particle may suddenly become the centre of the movement and compel the system to gyrate round it;',
'as every man of strong will, like Pisistratus, or Cromwell, does for a time, and every man of truth, like Plato or Paul, does forever.',
'But politics rest on necessary foundations, and cannot be treated with levity.',
'Republics abound in young civilians, who believe that the laws make the city, that grave modifications of the policy and modes of living and employments of the population, that commerce, education, and religion, may be voted in or out;',
'and that any measure, though it were absurd, may be imposed on a people if only you can get sufficient voices to make it a law.',
'But the wise know that foolish legislation is a rope of sand which perishes in the twisting;',
'that the State must follow and not lead the character and progress of the citizen;',
'the strongest usurper is quickly got rid of;',
'and they only who build on Ideas, build for eternity;',
'and that the form of government which prevails is the expression of what cultivation exists in the population which permits it.',
'The law is only a memorandum.',
'We are superstitious, and esteem the statute somewhat: so much life as it has in the character of living men is its force.',
'The statute stands there to say, Yesterday we agreed so and so, but how feel ye this article to-day?',
'Our statute is a currency which we stamp with our own portrait: it soon becomes unrecognizable, and in process of time will return to the mint.',
'Nature is not democratic, nor limited-monarchical, but despotic, and will not be fooled or abated of any jot of her authority by the pertest of her sons; and as fast as the public mind is opened to more intelligence, the code is seen to be brute and stammering.',
'It speaks not articulately, and must be made to.',
'Meantime the education of the general mind never stops.',
'The reveries of the true and simple are prophetic.',
'What the tender poetic youth dreams, and prays, and paints to-day, but shuns the ridicule of saying aloud, shall presently be the resolutions of public bodies;',
'then shall be carried as grievance and bill of rights through conflict and war, and then shall be triumphant law and establishment for a hundred years, until it gives place in turn to new prayers and pictures.',
'The history of the State sketches in coarse outline the progress of thought, and follows at a distance the delicacy of culture and of aspiration.',
'The theory of politics which has possessed the mind of men, and which they have expressed the best they could in their laws and in their revolutions, considers persons and property as the two objects for whose protection government exists.',
'Of persons, all have equal rights, in virtue of being identical in nature.',
'This interest of course with its whole power demands a democracy.',
'Whilst the rights of all as persons are equal, in virtue of their access to reason, their rights in property are very unequal.',
'One man owns his clothes, and another owns a county.',
'This accident, depending primarily on the skill and virtue of the parties, of which there is every degree, and secondarily on patrimony, falls unequally, and its rights of course are unequal.',
'Personal rights, universally the same, demand a government framed on the ratio of the census; property demands a government framed on the ratio of owners and of owning.',
'Laban, who has flocks and herds, wishes them looked after by an officer on the frontiers, lest the Midianites shall drive them off; and pays a tax to that end.',
'Jacob has no flocks or herds and no fear of the Midianites, and pays no tax to the officer.',
'It seemed fit that Laban and Jacob should have equal rights to elect the officer who is to defend their persons, but that Laban and not Jacob should elect the officer who is to guard the sheep and cattle.',
'And if question arise whether additional officers or watch-towers should be provided, must not Laban and Isaac, and those who must sell part of their herds to buy protection for the rest, judge better of this, and with more right, than Jacob, who,',
'because he is a youth and a traveller, eats their bread and not his own?',
'In the earliest society the proprietors made their own wealth, and so long as it comes to the owners in the direct way, no other opinion would arise in any equitable community than that property should make the law for property, and persons the law for persons.',
'But property passes through donation or inheritance to those who do not create it.',
'Gift, in one case, makes it as really the new owner’s, as labor made it the first owner’s: in the other case, of patrimony, the law makes an ownership which will be valid in each man’s view according to the estimate which he sets on the public tranquillity.',
'It was not however found easy to embody the readily admitted principle that property should make law for property, and persons for persons; since persons and property mixed themselves in every transaction.',
'At last it seemed settled that the rightful distinction was that the proprietors should have more elective franchise than non-proprietors, on the Spartan principle of “calling that which is just, equal; not that which is equal, just.”',
'That principle no longer looks so self-evident as it appeared in former times, partly,',
'because doubts have arisen whether too much weight had not been allowed in the laws to property, and such a structure given to our usages as allowed the rich to encroach on the poor, and to keep them poor;',
'but mainly because there is an instinctive sense, however obscure and yet inarticulate, that the whole constitution of property, on its present tenures, is injurious, and its influence on persons deteriorating and degrading;',
'that truly the only interest for the consideration of the State is persons;',
'that property will always follow persons;',
'that the highest end of government is the culture of men;',
'and if men can be educated, the institutions will share their improvement and the moral sentiment will write the law of the land.',
'If it be not easy to settle the equity of this question, the peril is less when we take note of our natural defences.',
'We are kept by better guards than the vigilance of such magistrates as we commonly elect.',
'Society always consists in greatest part of young and foolish persons.',
'The old, who have seen through the hypocrisy of courts and statesmen, die and leave no wisdom to their sons.',
'They believe their own newspaper, as their fathers did at their age.',
'With such an ignorant and deceivable majority, States would soon run to ruin, but that there are limitations beyond which the folly and ambition of governors cannot go.',
'Things have their laws, as well as men; and things refuse to be trifled with.',
'Property will be protected.',
'Corn will not grow unless it is planted and manured; but the farmer will not plant or hoe it unless the chances are a hundred to one that he will cut and harvest it.',
'Under any forms, persons and property must and will have their just sway.',
'They exert their power, as steadily as matter its attraction.',
'Cover up a pound of earth never so cunningly, divide and subdivide it;',
'melt it to liquid, convert it to gas;',
'it will always weigh a pound;',
'it will always attract and resist other matter by the full virtue of one pound weight:—and the attributes of a person, his wit and his moral energy, will exercise, under any law or extinguishing tyranny, their proper force,—if not overtly, then covertly;',
'if not for the law, then against it;',
'if not wholesomely, then poisonously;',
'with right, or by might.',
'The boundaries of personal influence it is impossible to fix, as persons are organs of moral or supernatural force.',
'Under the dominion of an idea which possesses the minds of multitudes, as civil freedom, or the religious sentiment, the powers of persons are no longer subjects of calculation.',
'A nation of men unanimously bent on freedom or conquest can easily confound the arithmetic of statists, and achieve extravagant actions, out of all proportion to their means; as the Greeks, the Saracens, the Swiss, the Americans, and the French have done.',
'In like manner to every particle of property belongs its own attraction.',
'A cent is the representative of a certain quantity of corn or other commodity.',
'Its value is in the necessities of the animal man.',
'It is so much warmth, so much bread, so much water, so much land.',
'The law may do what it will with the owner of property; its just power will still attach to the cent.',
'The law may in a mad freak say that all shall have power except the owners of property; they shall have no vote.',
'Nevertheless, by a higher law, the property will, year after year, write every statute that respects property.',
'The non-proprietor will be the scribe of the proprietor.',
'What the owners wish to do, the whole power of property will do, either through the law or else in defiance of it.',
'Of course I speak of all the property, not merely of the great estates.',
'When the rich are outvoted, as frequently happens, it is the joint treasury of the poor which exceeds their accumulations.',
'Every man owns something, if it is only a cow, or a wheel-barrow, or his arms, and so has that property to dispose of.',
'The same necessity which secures the rights of person and property against the malignity or folly of the magistrate, determines the form and methods of governing, which are proper to each nation and to its habit of thought, and nowise transferable to other states of society.',
'In this country we are very vain of our political institutions,',
'which are singular in this, that they sprung, within the memory of living men, from the character and condition of the people,',
'which they still express with sufficient fidelity,—and we ostentatiously prefer them to any other in history.',
'They are not better, but only fitter for us.',
'We may be wise in asserting the advantage in modern times of the democratic form, but to other states of society, in which religion consecrated the monarchical, that and not this was expedient.',
'Democracy is better for us, because the religious sentiment of the present time accords better with it.',
'Born democrats, we are nowise qualified to judge of monarchy, which, to our fathers living in the monarchical idea, was also relatively right.',
'But our institutions, though in coincidence with the spirit of the age, have not any exemption from the practical defects which have discredited other forms.',
'Every actual State is corrupt.',
'Good men must not obey the laws too well.',
'What satire on government can equal the severity of censure conveyed in the word politic, which now for ages has signified cunning, intimating that the State is a trick?',
'The same benign necessity and the same practical abuse appear in the parties, into which each State divides itself, of opponents and defenders of the administration of the government.',
'Parties are also founded on instincts, and have better guides to their own humble aims than the sagacity of their leaders.',
'They have nothing perverse in their origin, but rudely mark some real and lasting relation.',
'We might as wisely reprove the east wind or the frost, as a political party, whose members, for the most part, could give no account of their position, but stand for the defence of those interests in which they find themselves.',
'Our quarrel with them begins when they quit this deep natural ground at the bidding of some leader, and obeying personal considerations, throw themselves into the maintenance and defence of points nowise belonging to their system.',
'A party is perpetually corrupted by personality.',
'Whilst we absolve the association from dishonesty, we cannot extend the same charity to their leaders.',
'They reap the rewards of the docility and zeal of the masses which they direct.',
'Ordinarily our parties are parties of circumstance, and not of principle;',
'as the planting interest in conflict with the commercial;',
'the party of capitalists and that of operatives;',
'parties which are identical in their moral character, and which can easily change ground with each other in the support of many of their measures.',
'Parties of principle, as, religious sects, or the party of free-trade, of universal suffrage, of abolition of slavery, of abolition of capital punishment,—degenerate into personalities, or would inspire enthusiasm.',
'The vice of our leading parties in this country (which may be cited as a fair specimen of these societies of opinion) is that they do not plant themselves on the deep and necessary grounds to which they are respectively entitled,',
'but lash themselves to fury in the carrying of some local and momentary measure, nowise useful to the commonwealth.',
'Of the two great parties which at this hour almost share the nation between them, I should say that one has the best cause, and the other contains the best men.',
'The philosopher, the poet, or the religious man will of course wish to cast his vote with the democrat,',
'for free-trade,',
'for wide suffrage,',
'for the abolition of legal cruelties in the penal code, and for facilitating in every manner the access of the young and the poor to the sources of wealth and power.',
'But he can rarely accept the persons whom the so-called popular party propose to him as representatives of these liberalities.',
'They have not at heart the ends which give to the name of democracy what hope and virtue are in it.',
'The spirit of our American radicalism is destructive and aimless: it is not loving; it has no ulterior and divine ends, but is destructive only out of hatred and selfishness.',
'On the other side, the conservative party, composed of the most moderate, able, and cultivated part of the population, is timid, and merely defensive of property.',
'It vindicates no right, it aspires to no real good, it brands no crime, it proposes no generous policy;',
'it does not build, nor write, nor cherish the arts, nor foster religion, nor establish schools, nor encourage science, nor emancipate the slave, nor befriend the poor, or the Indian, or the immigrant.',
'From neither party, when in power, has the world any benefit to expect in science, art, or humanity, at all commensurate with the resources of the nation.',
'I do not for these defects despair of our republic.',
'We are not at the mercy of any waves of chance.',
'In the strife of ferocious parties, human nature always finds itself cherished; as the children of the convicts at Botany Bay are found to have as healthy a moral sentiment as other children.',
'Citizens of feudal states are alarmed at our democratic institutions lapsing into anarchy, and the older and more cautious among ourselves are learning from Europeans to look with some terror at our turbulent freedom.',
'It is said that in our license of construing the Constitution, and in the despotism of public opinion, we have no anchor; and one foreign observer thinks he has found the safeguard in the sanctity of Marriage among us; and another thinks he has found it in our Calvinism.',
'Fisher Ames expressed the popular security more wisely, when he compared a monarchy and a republic, saying that a monarchy is a merchantman, which sails well, but will sometimes strike on a rock and go to the bottom;',
'whilst a republic is a raft, which would never sink, but then your feet are always in water.',
'No forms can have any dangerous importance whilst we are befriended by the laws of things.',
'It makes no difference how many tons weight of atmosphere presses on our heads, so long as the same pressure resists it within the lungs.',
'Augment the mass a thousand fold, it cannot begin to crush us, as long as reaction is equal to action.',
'The fact of two poles, of two forces, centripetal and centrifugal, is universal, and each force by its own activity develops the other.',
'Wild liberty develops iron conscience.',
'Want of liberty, by strengthening law and decorum, stupefies conscience.',
'‘Lynch-law’ prevails only where there is greater hardihood and self-subsistency in the leaders.',
'A mob cannot be a permanency; everybody’s interest requires that it should not exist, and only justice satisfies all.',
'We must trust infinitely to the beneficent necessity which shines through all laws.',
'Human nature expresses itself in them as characteristically as in statues, or songs, or railroads; and an abstract of the codes of nations would be a transcript of the common conscience.',
'Governments have their origin in the moral identity of men.',
'Reason for one is seen to be reason for another, and for every other.',
'There is a middle measure which satisfies all parties, be they never so many or so resolute for their own.',
'Every man finds a sanction for his simplest claims and deeds in decisions of his own mind, which he calls Truth and Holiness.',
'In these decisions all the citizens find a perfect agreement, and only in these; not in what is good to eat, good to wear, good use of time, or what amount of land or of public aid, each is entitled to claim.',
'This truth and justice men presently endeavor to make application of to the measuring of land, the apportionment of service, the protection of life and property.',
'Their first endeavors, no doubt, are very awkward.',
'Yet absolute right is the first governor; or, every government is an impure theocracy.',
'The idea after which each community is aiming to make and mend its law, is the will of the wise man.',
'The wise man it cannot find in nature, and it makes awkward but earnest efforts to secure his government by contrivance;',
'as by causing the entire people to give their voices on every measure;',
'or by a double choice to get the representation of the whole;',
'or, by a selection of the best citizens;',
'or to secure the advantages of efficiency and internal peace by confiding the government to one, who may himself select his agents.',
'All forms of government symbolize an immortal government, common to all dynasties and independent of numbers, perfect where two men exist, perfect where there is only one man.',
'Every man’s nature is a sufficient advertisement to him of the character of his fellows.',
'My right and my wrong is their right and their wrong.',
'Whilst I do what is fit for me, and abstain from what is unfit, my neighbor and I shall often agree in our means, and work together for a time to one end.',
'But whenever I find my dominion over myself not sufficient for me, and undertake the direction of him also, I overstep the truth, and come into false relations to him.',
'I may have so much more skill or strength than he that he cannot express adequately his sense of wrong, but it is a lie, and hurts like a lie both him and me.',
'Love and nature cannot maintain the assumption; it must be executed by a practical lie, namely by force.',
'This undertaking for another is the blunder which stands in colossal ugliness in the governments of the world.',
'It is the same thing in numbers, as in a pair, only not quite so intelligible.',
'I can see well enough a great difference between my setting myself down to a self-control, and my going to make somebody else act after my views;',
'but when a quarter of the human race assume to tell me what I must do, I may be too much disturbed by the circumstances to see so clearly the absurdity of their command.',
'Therefore all public ends look vague and quixotic beside private ones.',
'For any laws but those which men make for themselves, are laughable.',
'If I put myself in the place of my child, and we stand in one thought and see that things are thus or thus, that perception is law for him and me.',
'We are both there, both act.',
'But if, without carrying him into the thought, I look over into his plot, and, guessing how it is with him, ordain this or that, he will never obey me.',
'This is the history of governments,—one man does something which is to bind another.',
'A man who cannot be acquainted with me, taxes me; looking from afar at me ordains that a part of my labor shall go to this or that whimsical end,—not as I, but as he happens to fancy.',
'Behold the consequence.',
'Of all debts men are least willing to pay the taxes.',
'What a satire is this on government!',
'Everywhere they think they get their money’s worth, except for these.',
'Hence the less government we have the better,—the fewer laws, and the less confided power.',
'The antidote to this abuse of formal Government is the influence of private character, the growth of the Individual;',
'the appearance of the principal to supersede the proxy;',
'the appearance of the wise man;',
'of whom the existing government is, it must be owned, but a shabby imitation.',
'That which all things tend to educe; which freedom, cultivation, intercourse, revolutions, go to form and deliver, is character; that is the end of Nature, to reach unto this coronation of her king.',
'To educate the wise man the State exists, and with the appearance of the wise man the State expires.',
'The appearance of character makes the State unnecessary.',
'The wise man is the State.',
'He needs no army, fort, or navy,—he loves men too well; no bribe, or feast, or palace, to draw friends to him; no vantage ground, no favorable circumstance.',
'He needs no library, for he has not done thinking; no church, for he is a prophet; no statute book, for he has the lawgiver; no money, for he is value; no road, for he is at home where he is; no experience, for the life of the creator shoots through him, and looks from his eyes.',
'He has no personal friends, for he who has the spell to draw the prayer and piety of all men unto him needs not husband and educate a few to share with him a select and poetic life.',
'His relation to men is angelic; his memory is myrrh to them; his presence, frankincense and flowers.',
'We think our civilization near its meridian, but we are yet only at the cock-crowing and the morning star.',
'In our barbarous society the influence of character is in its infancy.',
'As a political power, as the rightful lord who is to tumble all rulers from their chairs, its presence is hardly yet suspected.',
'Malthus and Ricardo quite omit it; the Annual Register is silent; in the Conversations’ Lexicon it is not set down; the President’s Message, the Queen’s Speech, have not mentioned it; and yet it is never nothing.',
'Every thought which genius and piety throw into the world, alters the world.',
'The gladiators in the lists of power feel, through all their frocks of force and simulation, the presence of worth.',
'I think the very strife of trade and ambition are confession of this divinity; and successes in those fields are the poor amends, the fig-leaf with which the shamed soul attempts to hide its nakedness.',
'I find the like unwilling homage in all quarters.',
'It is because we know how much is due from us that we are impatient to show some petty talent as a substitute for worth.',
'We are haunted by a conscience of this right to grandeur of character, and are false to it.',
'But each of us has some talent, can do somewhat useful, or graceful, or formidable, or amusing, or lucrative.',
'That we do, as an apology to others and to ourselves for not reaching the mark of a good and equal life.',
'But it does not satisfy us, whilst we thrust it on the notice of our companions.',
'It may throw dust in their eyes, but does not smooth our own brow, or give us the tranquillity of the strong when we walk abroad.',
'We do penance as we go.',
'Our talent is a sort of expiation, and we are constrained to reflect on our splendid moment with a certain humiliation, as somewhat too fine, and not as one act of many acts, a fair expression of our permanent energy.',
'Most persons of ability meet in society with a kind of tacit appeal.',
'Each seems to say, ‘I am not all here.’',
'Senators and presidents have climbed so high with pain enough, not because they think the place specially agreeable, but as an apology for real worth, and to vindicate their manhood in our eyes.',
'This conspicuous chair is their compensation to themselves for being of a poor, cold, hard nature.',
'They must do what they can.',
'Like one class of forest animals, they have nothing but a prehensile tail; climb they must, or crawl.',
'If a man found himself so rich-natured that he could enter into strict relations with the best persons and make life serene around him by the dignity and sweetness of his behavior,',
'could he afford to circumvent the favor of the caucus and the press, and covet relations so hollow and pompous as those of a politician?',
'Surely nobody would be a charlatan who could afford to be sincere.',
'The tendencies of the times favor the idea of self-government, and leave the individual, for all code, to the rewards and penalties of his own constitution; which work with more energy than we believe whilst we depend on artificial restraints.',
'The movement in this direction has been very marked in modern history.',
'Much has been blind and discreditable, but the nature of the revolution is not affected by the vices of the revolters; for this is a purely moral force.',
'It was never adopted by any party in history, neither can be.',
'It separates the individual from all party, and unites him at the same time to the race.',
'It promises a recognition of higher rights than those of personal freedom, or the security of property.',
'A man has a right to be employed, to be trusted, to be loved, to be revered.',
'The power of love, as the basis of a State, has never been tried.',
'We must not imagine that all things are lapsing into confusion if every tender protestant be not compelled to bear his part in certain social conventions;',
'nor doubt that roads can be built, letters carried, and the fruit of labor secured, when the government of force is at an end.',
'Are our methods now so excellent that all competition is hopeless? could not a nation of friends even devise better ways?',
'On the other hand, let not the most conservative and timid fear anything from a premature surrender of the bayonet and the system of force.',
'For, according to the order of nature, which is quite superior to our will, it stands thus;',
'there will always be a government of force where men are selfish;',
'and when they are pure enough to abjure the code of force they will be wise enough to see how these public ends of the post-office, of the highway, of commerce and the exchange of property, of museums and libraries, of institutions of art and science can be answered.',
'We live in a very low state of the world, and pay unwilling tribute to governments founded on force.',
'There is not, among the most religious and instructed men of the most religious and civil nations, a reliance on the moral sentiment and a sufficient belief in the unity of things,',
'to persuade them that society can be maintained without artificial restraints, as well as the solar system;',
'or that the private citizen might be reasonable and a good neighbor, without the hint of a jail or a confiscation.',
'What is strange too, there never was in any man sufficient faith in the power of rectitude to inspire him with the broad design of renovating the State on the principle of right and love.',
'All those who have pretended this design have been partial reformers, and have admitted in some manner the supremacy of the bad State.',
'I do not call to mind a single human being who has steadily denied the authority of the laws, on the simple ground of his own moral nature.',
'Such designs, full of genius and full of fate as they are, are not entertained except avowedly as air-pictures.',
'If the individual who exhibits them dare to think them practicable, he disgusts scholars and churchmen; and men of talent and women of superior sentiments cannot hide their contempt.',
'Not the less does nature continue to fill the heart of youth with suggestions of this enthusiasm, and there are now men,—',
'if indeed I can speak in the plural number,—',
'more exactly, I will say, I have just been conversing with one man,',
'to whom no weight of adverse experience will make it for a moment appear impossible that thousands of human beings might exercise towards each other the grandest and simplest sentiments, as well as a knot of friends, or a pair of lovers.',
'VIII: NONIMALIST AND REALIST.',

'So, in the new-born millions,',
'The perfect Adam lives.',
'Not less are summer-mornings dear',
'To every child they wake,',
'And each with novel life his sphere',
'Fills for his proper sake.',
'I CANNOT often enough say that a man is only a relative and representative nature.',
'Each is a hint of the truth, but far enough from being that truth which yet he quite newly and inevitably suggests to us.',
'If I seek it in him I shall not find it.',
'Could any man conduct into me the pure stream of that which he pretends to be!',
'Long afterwards I find that quality elsewhere which he promised me.',
'The genius of the Platonists is intoxicating to the student, yet how few particulars of it can I detach from all their books.',
'The man momentarily stands for the thought, but will not bear examination; and a society of men will cursorily represent well enough a certain quality and culture, for example, chivalry or beauty of manners; but separate them and there is no gentleman and no lady in the group.',
'The least hint sets us on the pursuit of a character which no man realizes.',
'We have such exorbitant eyes that on seeing the smallest arc we complete the curve, and when the curtain is lifted from the diagram which it seemed to veil, we are vexed to find that no more was drawn than just that fragment of an arc which we first beheld.',
'We are greatly too liberal in our construction of each other’s faculty and promise.',
'Exactly what the parties have already done they shall do again; but that which we inferred from their nature and inception, they will not do.',
'That is in nature, but not in them.',
'That happens in the world, which we often witness in a public debate.',
'Each of the speakers expresses himself imperfectly;',
'no one of them hears much that another says, such is the preoccupation of mind of each;',
'and the audience, who have only to hear and not to speak, judge very wisely and superiorly how wrongheaded and unskilful is each of the debaters to his own affair.',
'Great men or men of great gifts you shall easily find, but symmetrical men never.',
'When I meet a pure intellectual force or a generosity of affection, I believe here then is man;',
'and am presently mortified by the discovery that this individual is no more available to his own or to the general ends than his companions;',
'because the power which drew my respect is not supported by the total symphony of his talents.',
'All persons exist to society by some shining trait of beauty or utility which they have.',
'We borrow the proportions of the man from that one fine feature, and finish the portrait symmetrically; which is false, for the rest of his body is small or deformed.',
'I observe a person who makes a good public appearance, and conclude thence the perfection of his private character, on which this is based; but he has no private character.',
'He is a graceful cloak or lay-figure for holidays.',
'All our poets, heroes, and saints, fail utterly in some one or in many parts to satisfy our idea, fail to draw our spontaneous interest, and so leave us without any hope of realization but in our own future.',
'Our exaggeration of all fine characters arises from the fact that we identify each in turn with the soul.',
'But there are no such men as we fable; no Jesus, nor Pericles, nor Caesar, nor Angelo, nor Washington, such as we have made.',
'We consecrate a great deal of nonsense because it was allowed by great men.',
'There is none without his foible.',
'I verily believe if an angel should come to chant the chorus of the moral law, he would eat too much gingerbread, or take liberties with private letters, or do some precious atrocity.',
'It is bad enough that our geniuses cannot do anything useful, but it is worse that no man is fit for society who has fine traits.',
'He is admired at a distance, but he cannot come near without appearing a cripple.',
'The men of fine parts protect themselves by solitude, or by courtesy, or by satire, or by an acid worldly manner, each concealing as he best can his incapacity for useful association, but they want either love or self-reliance.',
'Our native love of reality joins with this experience to teach us a little reserve, and to dissuade a too sudden surrender to the brilliant qualities of persons.',
'Young people admire talents or particular excellences; as we grow older we value total powers and effects, as the impression, the quality, the spirit of men and things.',
'The genius is all.',
'The man,—it is his system: we do not try a solitary word or act, but his habit.',
'The acts which you praise, I praise not, since they are departures from his faith, and are mere compliances.',
'The magnetism which arranges tribes and races in one polarity is alone to be respected; the men are steel-filings.',
'Yet we unjustly select a particle, and say, ‘O steel-filing number one! what heart-drawings I feel to thee! what prodigious virtues are these of thine! how constitutional to thee, and incommunicable.’',
'Whilst we speak the loadstone is withdrawn; down falls our filing in a heap with the rest, and we continue our mummery to the wretched shaving.',
'Let us go for universals; for the magnetism, not for the needles.',
'Human life and its persons are poor empirical pretensions.',
'A personal influence is an ignis fatuus.',
'If they say it is great, it is great;',
'if they say it is small, it is small;',
'you see it, and you see it not, by turns;',
'it borrows all its size from the momentary estimation of the speakers: the Will-of-the-wisp vanishes if you go too near, vanishes if you go too far, and only blazes at one angle.',
'Who can tell if Washington be a great man or no?',
'Who can tell if Franklin be?',
'Yes, or any but the twelve, or six, or three great gods of fame?',
'And they too loom and fade before the eternal.',
'We are amphibious creatures, weaponed for two elements, having two sets of faculties, the particular and the catholic.',
'We adjust our instrument for general observation, and sweep the heavens as easily as we pick out a single figure in the terrestrial landscape.',
'We are practically skilful in detecting elements for which we have no place in our theory, and no name.',
'Thus we are very sensible of an atmospheric influence in men and in bodies of men, not accounted for in an arithmetical addition of all their measurable properties.',
'There is a genius of a nation, which is not to be found in the numerical citizens, but which characterizes the society.',
'England, strong, punctual, practical, well-spoken England I should not find if I should go to the island to seek it.',
'In the parliament, in the play-house, at dinner-tables, I might see a great number of rich, ignorant, book-read, conventional, proud men,—many old women,—and not anywhere the Englishman who made the good speeches, combined the accurate engines, and did the bold and nervous deeds.',
'It is even worse in America, where, from the intellectual quickness of the race, the genius of the country is more splendid in its promise and more slight in its performance.',
'Webster cannot do the work of Webster.',
'We conceive distinctly enough the French, the Spanish, the German genius, and it is not the less real that perhaps we should not meet in either of those nations a single individual who corresponded with the type.',
'We infer the spirit of the nation in great measure from the language, which is a sort of monument to which each forcible individual in a course of many hundred years has contributed a stone.',
'And, universally, a good example of this social force is the veracity of language, which cannot be debauched.',
'In any controversy concerning morals, an appeal may be made with safety to the sentiments which the language of the people expresses.',
'Proverbs, words, and grammar-inflections convey the public sense with more purity and precision than the wisest individual.',
'In the famous dispute with the Nominalists, the Realists had a good deal of reason.',
'General ideas are essences.',
'They are our gods: they round and ennoble the most partial and sordid way of living.',
'Our proclivity to details cannot quite degrade our life and divest it of poetry.',
'The day-laborer is reckoned as standing at the foot of the social scale, yet he is saturated with the laws of the world.',
'His measures are the hours; morning and night, solstice and equinox, geometry, astronomy and all the lovely accidents of nature play through his mind.',
'Money, which represents the prose of life, and which is hardly spoken of in parlors without an apology, is, in its effects and laws, as beautiful as roses.',
'Property keeps the accounts of the world, and is always moral.',
'The property will be found where the labor, the wisdom, and the virtue have been in nations, in classes, and (the whole life-time considered, with the compensations) in the individual also.',
'How wise the world appears, when the laws and usages of nations are largely detailed, and the completeness of the municipal system is considered!',
'Nothing is left out.',
'If you go into the markets and the custom-houses, the insurers’ and notaries’ offices, the offices of sealers of weights and measures, of inspection of provisions,—it will appear as if one man had made it all.',
'Wherever you go, a wit like your own has been before you, and has realized its thought.',
'The Eleusinian mysteries, the Egyptian architecture, the Indian astronomy, the Greek sculpture, show that there always were seeing and knowing men in the planet.',
'The world is full of masonic ties, of guilds, of secret and public legions of honor; that of scholars, for example; and that of gentlemen, fraternizing with the upper class of every country and every culture.',
'I am very much struck in literature by the appearance that one person wrote all the books;',
'as if the editor of a journal planted his body of reporters in different parts of the field of action, and relieved some by others from time to time;',
'but there is such equality and identity both of judgment and point of view in the narrative that it is plainly the work of one all-seeing, all-hearing gentleman.',
'I looked into Pope’s Odyssey yesterday: it is as correct and elegant after our canon of to-day as if it were newly written.',
'The modernness of all good books seems to give me an existence as wide as man.',
'What is well done I feel as if I did; what is ill done I reck not of.',
'Shakspeare’s passages of passion (for example, in Lear and Hamlet) are in the very dialect of the present year.',
'I am faithful again to the whole over the members in my use of books.',
'I find the most pleasure in reading a book in a manner least flattering to the author.',
'I read Proclus, and sometimes Plato, as I might read a dictionary, for a mechanical help to the fancy and the imagination.',
'I read for the lustres, as if one should use a fine picture in a chromatic experiment, for its rich colors.',
'‘Tis not Proclus, but a piece of nature and fate that I explore.',
'It is a greater joy to see the author’s author, than himself.',
'A higher pleasure of the same kind I found lately at a concert, where I went to hear Handel’s Messiah.',
'As the master overpowered the littleness and incapableness of the performers and made them conductors of his electricity,',
'so it was easy to observe what efforts nature was making, through so many hoarse, wooden, and imperfect persons, to produce beautiful voices, fluid and soul-guided men and women.',
'The genius of nature was paramount at the oratorio.',
'This preference of the genius to the parts is the secret of that deification of art, which is found in all superior minds.',
'Art, in the artist, is proportion, or a habitual respect to the whole by an eye loving beauty in details.',
'And the wonder and charm of it is the sanity in insanity which it denotes.',
'Proportion is almost impossible to human beings.',
'There is no one who does not exaggerate.',
'In conversation, men are encumbered with personality, and talk too much.',
'In modern sculpture, picture, and poetry, the beauty is miscellaneous; the artist works here and there and at all points, adding and adding, instead of unfolding the unit of his thought.',
'Beautiful details we must have, or no artist; but they must be means and never other.',
'The eye must not lose sight for a moment of the purpose.',
'Lively boys write to their ear and eye, and the cool reader finds nothing but sweet jingles in it.',
'When they grow older, they respect the argument.',
'We obey the same intellectual integrity when we study in exceptions the law of the world.',
'Anomalous facts, as the never quite obsolete rumors of magic and demonology, and the new allegations of phrenologists and neurologists, are of ideal use.',
'They are good indications.',
'Homoeopathy is insignificant as an art of healing, but of great value as criticism on the hygeia or medical practice of the time.',
'So with Mesmerism, Swedenborgism, Fourierism, and the Millennial Church; they are poor pretensions enough, but good criticism on the science, philosophy, and preaching of the day.',
'For these abnormal insights of the adepts ought to be normal, and things of course.',
'All things show us that on every side we are very near to the best.',
'It seems not worth while to execute with too much pains some one intellectual, or aesthetical, or civil feat, when presently the dream will scatter, and we shall burst into universal power.',
'The reason of idleness and of crime is the deferring of our hopes.',
'Whilst we are waiting we beguile the time with jokes, with sleep, with eating, and with crimes.',
'Thus we settle it in our cool libraries, that all the agents with which we deal are subalterns, which we can well afford to let pass, and life will be simpler when we live at the centre and flout the surfaces.',
'I wish to speak with all respect of persons, but sometimes I must pinch myself to keep awake and preserve the due decorum.',
'They melt so fast into each other that they are like grass and trees, and it needs an effort to treat them as individuals.',
'Though the uninspired man certainly finds persons a conveniency in household matters, the divine man does not respect them; he sees them as a rack of clouds, or a fleet of ripples which the wind drives over the surface of the water.',
'But this is flat rebellion.',
'Nature will not be Buddhist: she resents generalizing, and insults the philosopher in every moment with a million of fresh particulars.',
'It is all idle talking: as much as a man is a whole, so is he also a part; and it were partial not to see it.',
'What you say in your pompous distribution only distributes you into your class and section.',
'You have not got rid of parts by denying them, but are the more partial.',
'You are one thing, but Nature is one thing and the other thing, in the same moment.',
'She will not remain orbed in a thought, but rushes into persons; and when each person, inflamed to a fury of personality, would conquer all things to his poor crotchet, she raises up against him another person, and by many persons incarnates again a sort of whole.',
'She will have all.',
'Nick Bottom cannot play all the parts, work it how he may; there will be somebody else, and the world will be round.',
'Everything must have its flower or effort at the beautiful, coarser or finer according to its stuff.',
'They relieve and recommend each other, and the sanity of society is a balance of a thousand insanities.',
'She punishes abstractionists, and will only forgive an induction which is rare and casual.',
'We like to come to a height of land and see the landscape, just as we value a general remark in conversation.',
'But it is not the intention of Nature that we should live by general views.',
'We fetch fire and water, run about all day among the shops and markets, and get our clothes and shoes made and mended, and are the victims of these details; and once in a fortnight we arrive perhaps at a rational moment.',
'If we were not thus infatuated, if we saw the real from hour to hour, we should not be here to write and to read, but should have been burned or frozen long ago.',
'She would never get anything done, if she suffered admirable Crichtons and universal geniuses.',
'She loves better a wheelwright who dreams all night of wheels, and a groom who is part of his horse; for she is full of work, and these are her hands.',
'As the frugal farmer takes care that his cattle shall eat down the rowen, and swine shall eat the waste of his house, and poultry shall pick the crumbs,—',
'so our economical mother dispatches a new genius and habit of mind into every district and condition of existence, plants an eye wherever a new ray of light can fall,',
'and gathering up into some man every property in the universe, establishes thousandfold occult mutual attractions among her offspring,',
'that all this wash and waste of power may be imparted and exchanged.',
'Great dangers undoubtedly accrue from this incarnation and distribution of the godhead, and hence Nature has her maligners, as if she were Circe; and Alphonso of Castille fancied he could have given useful advice.',
'But she does not go unprovided; she has hellebore at the bottom of the cup.',
'Solitude would ripen a plentiful crop of despots.',
'The recluse thinks of men as having his manner, or as not having his manner; and as having degrees of it, more and less.',
'But when he comes into a public assembly he sees that men have very different manners from his own, and in their way admirable.',
'In his childhood and youth he has had many checks and censures, and thinks modestly enough of his own endowment.',
'When afterwards he comes to unfold it in propitious circumstance, it seems the only talent; he is delighted with his success, and accounts himself already the fellow of the great.',
'But he goes into a mob, into a banking house, into a mechanic’s shop, into a mill, into a laboratory, into a ship, into a camp, and in each new place he is no better than an idiot; other talents take place, and rule the hour.',
'The rotation which whirls every leaf and pebble to the meridian, reaches to every gift of man, and we all take turns at the top.',
'For Nature, who abhors mannerism, has set her heart on breaking up all styles and tricks, and it is so much easier to do what one has done before than to do a new thing, that there is a perpetual tendency to a set mode.',
'In every conversation, even the highest, there is a certain trick, which may be soon learned by an acute person and then that particular style continued indefinitely.',
'Each man too is a tyrant in tendency, because he would impose his idea on others; and their trick is their natural defence.',
'Jesus would absorb the race; but Tom Paine or the coarsest blasphemer helps humanity by resisting this exuberance of power.',
'Hence the immense benefit of party in politics, as it reveals faults of character in a chief, which the intellectual force of the persons, with ordinary opportunity and not hurled into aphelion by hatred, could not have seen.',
'Since we are all so stupid, what benefit that there should be two stupidities!',
'It is like that brute advantage so essential to astronomy, of having the diameter of the earth’s orbit for a base of its triangles.',
'Democracy is morose, and runs to anarchy, but in the State and in the schools it is indispensable to resist the consolidation of all men into a few men.',
'If John was perfect, why are you and I alive?',
'As long as any man exists, there is some need of him; let him fight for his own.',
'A new poet has appeared; a new character approached us; why should we refuse to eat bread until we have found his regiment and section in our old army-files?',
'Why not a new man?',
'Here is a new enterprise of Brook Farm, of Skeneateles, of Northampton: why so impatient to baptize them Essenes, or Port-Royalists, or Shakers, or by any known and effete name?',
'Let it be a new way of living.',
'Why have only two or three ways of life, and not thousands?',
'Every man is wanted, and no man is wanted much.',
'We came this time for condiments, not for corn.',
'We want the great genius only for joy; for one star more in our constellation, for one tree more in our grove.',
'But he thinks we wish to belong to him, as he wishes to occupy us.',
'He greatly mistakes us.',
'I think I have done well if I have acquired a new word from a good author; and my business with him is to find my own, though it were only to melt him down into an epithet or an image for daily use:—',
'“Into paint will I grind thee, my bride!”',
'To embroil the confusion, and make it impossible to arrive at any general statement,—when we have insisted on the imperfection of individuals, our affections and our experience urge that every individual is entitled to honor, and a very generous treatment is sure to be repaid.',
'A recluse sees only two or three persons, and allows them all their room; they spread themselves at large.',
'The statesman looks at many, and compares the few habitually with others, and these look less.',
'Yet are they not entitled to this generosity of reception? and is not munificence the means of insight?',
'For though gamesters say that the cards beat all the players, though they were never so skilful, yet in the contest we are now considering, the players are also the game, and share the power of the cards.',
'If you criticise a fine genius, the odds are that you are out of your reckoning, and instead of the poet, are censuring your own caricature of him.',
'For there is somewhat spheral and infinite in every man, especially in every genius, which, if you can come very near him, sports with all your limitations.',
'For rightly every man is a channel through which heaven floweth, and whilst I fancied I was criticising him, I was censuring or rather terminating my own soul.',
'After taxing Goethe as a courtier, artificial, unbelieving, worldly,—I took up this book of Helena, and found him an Indian of the wilderness, a piece of pure nature like an apple or an oak, large as morning or night, and virtuous as a brier-rose.',
'But care is taken that the whole tune shall be played.',
'If we were not kept among surfaces, every thing would be large and universal; now the excluded attributes burst in on us with the more brightness that they have been excluded.',
'“Your turn now, my turn next,” is the rule of the game.',
'The universality being hindered in its primary form, comes in the secondary form of all sides; the points come in succession to the meridian, and by the speed of rotation a new whole is formed.',
'Nature keeps herself whole and her representation complete in the experience of each mind.',
'She suffers no seat to be vacant in her college.',
'It is the secret of the world that all things subsist and do not die but only retire a little from sight and afterwards return again.',
'Whatever does not concern us is concealed from us.',
'As soon as a person is no longer related to our present well-being, he is concealed, or dies, as we say.',
'Really, all things and persons are related to us, but according to our nature they act on us not at once but in succession, and we are made aware of their presence one at a time.',
'All persons, all things which we have known, are here present, and many more than we see; the world is full.',
'As the ancient said, the world is a plenum or solid; and if we saw all things that really surround us we should be imprisoned and unable to move.',
'For though nothing is impassable to the soul, but all things are pervious to it and like highways, yet this is only whilst the soul does not see them.',
'As soon as the soul sees any object, it stops before that object.',
'Therefore, the divine Providence which keeps the universe open in every direction to the soul, conceals all the furniture and all the persons that do not concern a particular soul, from the senses of that individual.',
'Through solidest eternal things the man finds his road as if they did not subsist, and does not once suspect their being.',
'As soon as he needs a new object, suddenly he beholds it, and no longer attempts to pass through it, but takes another way.',
'When he has exhausted for the time the nourishment to be drawn from any one person or thing, that object is withdrawn from his observation, and though still in his immediate neighborhood, he does not suspect its presence.',
'Nothing is dead: men feign themselves dead, and endure mock funerals and mournful obituaries, and there they stand looking out of the window, sound and well, in some new and strange disguise.',
'Jesus is not dead; he is very well alive: nor John, nor Paul, nor Mahomet, nor Aristotle; at times we believe we have seen them all, and could easily tell the names under which they go.',
'If we cannot make voluntary and conscious steps in the admirable science of universals, let us see the parts wisely, and infer the genius of nature from the best particulars with a becoming charity.',
'What is best in each kind is an index of what should be the average of that thing.',
'Love shows me the opulence of nature, by disclosing to me in my friend a hidden wealth, and I infer an equal depth of good in every other direction.',
'It is commonly said by farmers that a good pear or apple costs no more time or pains to rear than a poor one; so I would have no work of art, no speech, or action, or thought, or friend, but the best.',
'The end and the means, the gamester and the game,—life is made up of the intermixture and reaction of these two amicable powers, whose marriage appears beforehand monstrous, as each denies and tends to abolish the other.',
'We must reconcile the contradictions as we can, but their discord and their concord introduce wild absurdities into our thinking and speech.',
'No sentence will hold the whole truth, and the only way in which we can be just, is by giving ourselves the lie;',
'Speech is better than silence;',
'silence is better than speech;—All things are in contact;',
'every atom has a sphere of repulsion;—Things are, and are not, at the same time;—and the like.',
'All the universe over, there is but one thing, this old Two-Face, creator-creature, mind-matter, right-wrong, of which any proposition may be affirmed or denied.',
'Very fitly therefore I assert that every man is a partialist, that nature secures him as an instrument by self-conceit, preventing the tendencies to religion and science;',
'and now further assert, that, each man’s genius being nearly and affectionately explored, he is justified in his individuality, as his nature is found to be immense;',
'and now I add that every man is a universalist also, and, as our earth, whilst it spins on its own axis, spins all the time around the sun through the celestial spaces,',
'so the least of its rational children, the most dedicated to his private affair, works out, though as it were under a disguise, the universal problem.',
'We fancy men are individuals; so are pumpkins; but every pumpkin in the field goes through every point of pumpkin history.',
'The rabid democrat, as soon as he is senator and rich man, has ripened beyond possibility of sincere radicalism, and unless he can resist the sun, he must be conservative the remainder of his days.',
'Lord Eldon said in his old age that “if he were to begin life again, he would be damned but he would begin as agitator.”',
'We hide this universality if we can, but it appears at all points.',
'We are as ungrateful as children.',
'There is nothing we cherish and strive to draw to us but in some hour we turn and rend it.',
'We keep a running fire of sarcasm at ignorance and the life of the senses;',
'then goes by, perchance, a fair girl, a piece of life, gay and happy, and making the commonest offices beautiful by the energy and heart with which she does them;',
'and seeing this we admire and love her and them, and say, ‘Lo! a genuine creature of the fair earth, not dissipated or too early ripened by books, philosophy, religion,',
'society, or care!’ insinuating a treachery and contempt for all we had so long loved and wrought in ourselves and others.',
'If we could have any security against moods!',
'If the profoundest prophet could be holden to his words, and the hearer who is ready to sell all and join the crusade could have any certificate that tomorrow his prophet shall not unsay his testimony!',
'But the Truth sits veiled there on the Bench, and never interposes an adamantine syllable;',
'and the most sincere and revolutionary doctrine, put as if the ark of God were carried forward some furlongs, and planted there for the succor of the world, shall in a few weeks be coldly set aside by the same speaker, as morbid;',
'“I thought I was right, but I was not,”—and the same immeasurable credulity demanded for new audacities.',
'If we were not of all opinions! if we did not in any moment shift the platform on which we stand, and look and speak from another! if there could be any regulation, any ‘one-hour-rule,’ that a man should never leave his point of view without sound of trumpet.',
'I am always insincere, as always knowing there are other moods.',
'How sincere and confidential we can be, saying all that lies in the mind, and yet go away feeling that all is yet unsaid, from the incapacity of the parties to know each other, although they use the same words!',
'My companion assumes to know my mood and habit of thought, and we go on from explanation to explanation until all is said which words can, and we leave matters just as they were at first, because of that vicious assumption.',
'Is it that every man believes every other to be an incurable partialist, and himself a universalist?',
'I talked yesterday with a pair of philosophers;',
'I endeavored to show my good men that I love everything by turns and nothing long;',
'that I loved the centre, but doated on the superficies;',
'that I loved man, if men seemed to me mice and rats;',
'that I revered saints, but woke up glad that the old pagan world stood its ground and died hard;',
'that I was glad of men of every gift and nobility, but would not live in their arms.',
'Could they but once understand that I loved to know that they existed, and heartily wished them God-speed,',
'yet, out of my poverty of life and thought, had no word or welcome for them when they came to see me, and could well consent to their living in Oregon, for any claim I felt on them,—',
'it would be a great satisfaction.',
'NEW ENGLAND REFORMERS.',
'In the suburb, in the town,',
'On the railway, in the square,',
'Came a beam of goodness down',
'Doubling daylight everywhere:',
'Peace now each for malice takes,',
'Beauty for his sinful weeks,',
'For the angel Hope aye makes',
'Him an angel whom she leads.',
'A LECTURE READ BEFORE THE SOCIETY IN AMORY HALL, ON SUNDAY, MARCH 3, 1844.',
'WHOEVER has had opportunity of acquaintance with society in New England during the last twenty-five years, with those middle and with those leading sections that may constitute any just representation of the character and aim of the community,',
'will have been struck with the great activity of thought and experimenting.',
'His attention must be commanded by the signs that the Church, or religious party, is falling from the Church nominal, and is appearing in temperance and non-resistance societies;',
'in movements of abolitionists and of socialists;',
'and in very significant assemblies called Sabbath and Bible Conventions;',
'composed of ultraists, of seekers, of all the soul of the soldiery of dissent, and meeting to call in question the authority of the Sabbath, of the priesthood, and of the Church.',
'In these movements nothing was more remarkable than the discontent they begot in the movers.',
'The spirit of protest and of detachment drove the members of these Conventions to bear testimony against the Church, and immediately afterward,',
'to declare their discontent with these Conventions, their independence of their colleagues, and their impatience of the methods whereby they were working.',
'They defied each other, like a congress of kings, each of whom had a realm to rule, and a way of his own that made concert unprofitable.',
'What a fertility of projects for the salvation of the world!',
'One apostle thought all men should go to farming, and another that no man should buy or sell, that the use of money was the cardinal evil; another that the mischief was in our diet, that we eat and drink damnation.',
'These made unleavened bread, and were foes to the death to fermentation.',
'It was in vain urged by the housewife that God made yeast, as well as dough, and loves fermentation just as dearly as he loves vegetation; that fermentation develops the saccharine element in the grain, and makes it more palatable and more digestible.',
'No; they wish the pure wheat, and will die but it shall not ferment.',
'Stop, dear nature, these incessant advances of thine; let us scotch these ever-rolling wheels!',
'Others attacked the system of agriculture, the use of animal manures in farming, and the tyranny of man over brute nature; these abuses polluted his food.',
'The ox must be taken from the plough and the horse from the cart, the hundred acres of the farm must be spaded, and the man must walk, wherever boats and locomotives will not carry him.',
'Even the insect world was to be defended,—that had been too long neglected, and a society for the protection of ground-worms, slugs, and mosquitos was to be incorporated without delay.',
'With these appeared the adepts of homoeopathy, of hydropathy, of mesmerism, of phrenology, and their wonderful theories of the Christian miracles!',
'Others assailed particular vocations, as that of the lawyer, that of the merchant, of the manufacturer, of the clergyman, of the scholar.',
'Others attacked the institution of marriage as the fountain of social evils.',
'Others devoted themselves to the worrying of churches and meetings for public worship; and the fertile forms of antinomianism among the elder puritans seemed to have their match in the plenty of the new harvest of reform.',
'With this din of opinion and debate there was a keener scrutiny of institutions and domestic life than any we had known; there was sincere protesting against existing evils, and there were changes of employment dictated by conscience.',
'No doubt there was plentiful vaporing, and cases of backsliding might occur.',
'But in each of these movements emerged a good result, a tendency to the adoption of simpler methods, and an assertion of the sufficiency of the private man.',
'Thus it was directly in the spirit and genius of the age,',
'what happened in one instance when a church censured and threatened to excommunicate one of its members on account of the somewhat hostile part to the church which his conscience led him to take in the anti-slavery business;',
'the threatened individual immediately excommunicated the church in a public and formal process.',
'This has been several times repeated: it was excellent when it was done the first time, but of course loses all value when it is copied.',
'Every project in the history of reform, no matter how violent and surprising, is good when it is the dictate of a man’s genius and constitution, but very dull and suspicious when adopted from another.',
'It is right and beautiful in any man to say, ‘I will take this coat, or this book, or this measure of corn of yours,’—in whom we see the act to be original, and to flow from the whole spirit and faith of him;',
'for then that taking will have a giving as free and divine;',
'but we are very easily disposed to resist the same generosity of speech when we miss originality and truth to character in it.',
'There was in all the practical activities of New England for the last quarter of a century, a gradual withdrawal of tender consciences from the social organizations.',
'There is observable throughout, the contest between mechanical and spiritual methods, but with a steady tendency of the thoughtful and virtuous to a deeper belief and reliance on spiritual facts.',
'In politics for example it is easy to see the progress of dissent.',
'The country is full of rebellion; the country is full of kings.',
'Hands off! let there be no control and no interference in the administration of the affairs of this kingdom of me.',
'Hence the growth of the doctrine and of the party of Free Trade, and the willingness to try that experiment, in the face of what appear incontestable facts.',
'I confess, the motto of the Globe newspaper is so attractive to me that I can seldom find much appetite to read what is below it in its columns: “The world is governed too much.”',
'So the country is frequently affording solitary examples of resistance to the government, solitary nullifiers, who throw themselves on their reserved rights;',
'nay, who have reserved all their rights;',
'who reply to the assessor and to the clerk of court that they do not know the State, and embarrass the courts of law by non-juring and the commander-in-chief of the militia by non-resistance.',
'The same disposition to scrutiny and dissent appeared in civil, festive, neighborly, and domestic society.',
'A restless, prying, conscientious criticism broke out in unexpected quarters.',
'Who gave me the money with which I bought my coat?',
'Why should professional labor and that of the counting-house be paid so disproportionately to the labor of the porter and woodsawyer?',
'This whole business of Trade gives me to pause and think, as it constitutes false relations between men;',
'inasmuch as I am prone to count myself relieved of any responsibility to behave well and nobly to that person whom I pay with money;',
'whereas if I had not that commodity, I should be put on my good behavior in all companies, and man would be a benefactor to man, as being himself his only certificate that he had a right to those aids and services which each asked of the other.',
'Am I not too protected a person? is there not a wide disparity between the lot of me and the lot of thee, my poor brother, my poor sister?',
'Am I not defrauded of my best culture in the loss of those gymnastics which manual labor and the emergencies of poverty constitute?',
'I find nothing healthful or exalting in the smooth conventions of society; I do not like the close air of saloons.',
'I begin to suspect myself to be a prisoner, though treated with all this courtesy and luxury.',
'I pay a destructive tax in my conformity.',
'The same insatiable criticism may be traced in the efforts for the reform of Education.',
'The popular education has been taxed with a want of truth and nature.',
'It was complained that an education to things was not given.',
'We are students of words: we are shut up in schools, and colleges, and recitation-rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bag of wind, a memory of words, and do not know a thing.',
'We cannot use our hands, or our legs, or our eyes, or our arms.',
'We do not know an edible root in the woods, we cannot tell our course by the stars, nor the hour of the day by the sun.',
'It is well if we can swim and skate.',
'We are afraid of a horse, of a cow, of a dog, of a snake, of a spider.',
'The Roman rule was to teach a boy nothing that he could not learn standing.',
'The old English rule was, ‘All summer in the field, and all winter in the study.’',
'And it seems as if a man should learn to plant, or to fish, or to hunt, that he might secure his subsistence at all events, and not be painful to his friends and fellow-men.',
'The lessons of science should be experimental also.',
'The sight of the planet through a telescope is worth all the course on astronomy; the shock of the electric spark in the elbow, outvalues all the theories; the taste of the nitrous oxide, the firing of an artificial volcano, are better than volumes of chemistry.',
'One of the traits of the new spirit is the inquisition it fixed on our scholastic devotion to the dead languages.',
'The ancient languages, with great beauty of structure, contain wonderful remains of genius, which draw, and always will draw, certain likeminded men,—Greek men, and Roman men,—in all countries, to their study;',
'but by a wonderful drowsiness of usage they had exacted the study of all men.',
'Once (say two centuries ago), Latin and Greek had a strict relation to all the science and culture there was in Europe, and the Mathematics had a momentary importance at some era of activity in physical science.',
'These things became stereotyped as education, as the manner of men is.',
'But the Good Spirit never cared for the colleges, and though all men and boys were now drilled in Latin, Greek, and Mathematics, it had quite left these shells high and dry on the beach, and was now creating and feeding other matters at other ends of the world.',
'But in a hundred high schools and colleges this warfare against common sense still goes on.',
'Four, or six, or ten years, the pupil is parsing Greek and Latin, and as soon as he leaves the University, as it is ludicrously called, he shuts those books for the last time.',
'Some thousands of young men are graduated at our colleges in this country every year, and the persons who, at forty years, still read Greek, can all be counted on your hand.',
'I never met with ten.',
'Four or five persons I have seen who read Plato.',
'But is not this absurd, that the whole liberal talent of this country should be directed in its best years on studies which lead to nothing?',
'What was the consequence?',
'Some intelligent persons said or thought, ‘Is that Greek and Latin some spell to conjure with, and not words of reason?',
'If the physician, the lawyer, the divine, never use it to come at their ends, I need never learn it to come at mine.',
'Conjuring is gone out of fashion, and I will omit this conjugating, and go straight to affairs.’',
'So they jumped the Greek and Latin, and read law, medicine, or sermons, without it.',
'To the astonishment of all, the self-made men took even ground at once with the oldest of the regular graduates, and in a few months the most conservative circles of Boston and New York had quite forgotten who of their gownsmen was college-bred, and who was not.',
'One tendency appears alike in the philosophical speculation and in the rudest democratical movements, through all the petulance and all the puerility, the wish, namely, to cast aside the superfluous and arrive at short methods;',
'urged, as I suppose, by an intuition that the human spirit is equal to all emergencies, alone, and that man is more often injured than helped by the means he uses.',
'I conceive this gradual casting off of material aids, and the indication of growing trust in the private self-supplied powers of the individual,',
'to be the affirmative principle of the recent philosophy, and that it is feeling its own profound truth and is reaching forward at this very hour to the happiest conclusions.',
'I readily concede that in this, as in every period of intellectual activity, there has been a noise of denial and protest; much was to be resisted, much was to be got rid of by those who were reared in the old, before they could begin to affirm and to construct.',
'Many a reformer perishes in his removal of rubbish; and that makes the offensiveness of the class.',
'They are partial; they are not equal to the work they pretend.',
'They lose their way; in the assault on the kingdom of darkness they expend all their energy on some accidental evil, and lose their sanity and power of benefit.',
'It is of little moment that one or two or twenty errors of our social system be corrected, but of much that the man be in his senses.',
'The criticism and attack on institutions,',
'which we have witnessed, has made one thing plain, that society gains nothing whilst a man, not himself renovated, attempts to renovate things around him: he has become tediously good in some particular but negligent or narrow in the rest;',
'and hypocrisy and vanity are often the disgusting result.',
'It is handsomer to remain in the establishment better than the establishment, and conduct that in the best manner, than to make a sally against evil by some single improvement, without supporting it by a total regeneration.',
'Do not be so vain of your one objection.',
'Do you think there is only one?',
'Alas! my good friend, there is no part of society or of life better than any other part.',
'All our things are right and wrong together.',
'The wave of evil washes all our institutions alike.',
'Do you complain of our Marriage?',
'Our marriage is no worse than our education, our diet, our trade, our social customs.',
'Do you complain of the laws of Property?',
'It is a pedantry to give such importance to them.',
'Can we not play the game of life with these counters, as well as with those? in the institution of property, as well as out of it?',
'Let into it the new and renewing principle of love, and property will be universality.',
'No one gives the impression of superiority to the institution, which he must give who will reform it.',
'It makes no difference what you say, you must make me feel that you are aloof from it; by your natural and supernatural advantages do easily see to the end of it,—do see how man can do without it.',
'Now all men are on one side.',
'No man deserves to be heard against property.',
'Only Love, only an Idea, is against property as we hold it.',
'I cannot afford to be irritable and captious, nor to waste all my time in attacks.',
'If I should go out of church whenever I hear a false sentiment I could never stay there five minutes.',
'But why come out? the street is as false as the church, and when I get to my house, or to my manners, or to my speech, I have not got away from the lie.',
'When we see an eager assailant of one of these wrongs, a special reformer, we feel like asking him, What right have you, sir, to your one virtue?',
'Is virtue piecemeal?',
'This is a jewel amidst the rags of a beggar.',
'In another way the right will be vindicated.',
'In the midst of abuses, in the heart of cities, in the aisles of false churches, alike in one place and in another,—',
'wherever, namely, a just and heroic soul finds itself, there it will do what is next at hand, and by the new quality of character it shall put forth it shall abrogate that old condition, law or school in which it stands, before the law of its own mind.',
'If partiality was one fault of the movement party, the other defect was their reliance on Association.',
'Doubts such as those I have intimated drove many good persons to agitate the questions of social reform.',
'But the revolt against the spirit of commerce, the spirit of aristocracy, and the inveterate abuses of cities, did not appear possible to individuals; and to do battle against numbers they armed themselves with numbers, and against concert they relied on new concert.',
'Following or advancing beyond the ideas of St. Simon, of Fourier, and of Owen, three communities have already been formed in Massachusetts on kindred plans, and many more in the country at large.',
'They aim to give every member a share in the manual labor, to give an equal reward to labor and to talent, and to unite a liberal culture with an education to labor.',
'The scheme offers, by the economies of associated labor and expense, to make every member rich, on the same amount of property, that, in separate families, would leave every member poor.',
'These new associations are composed of men and women of superior talents and sentiments;',
'yet it may easily be questioned whether such a community will draw, except in its beginnings, the able and the good;',
'whether those who have energy will not prefer their chance of superiority and power in the world, to the humble certainties of the association;',
'whether such a retreat does not promise to become an asylum to those who have tried and failed, rather than a field to the strong;',
'and whether the members will not necessarily be fractions of men, because each finds that he cannot enter it, without some compromise.',
'Friendship and association are very fine things, and a grand phalanx of the best of the human race, banded for some catholic object; yes, excellent; but remember that no society can ever be so large as one man.',
'He, in his friendship, in his natural and momentary associations, doubles or multiplies himself; but in the hour in which he mortgages himself to two or ten or twenty, he dwarfs himself below the stature of one.',
'But the men of less faith could not thus believe, and to such, concert appears the sole specific of strength.',
'I have failed, and you have failed, but perhaps together we shall not fail.',
'Our housekeeping is not satisfactory to us, but perhaps a phalanx, a community, might be.',
'Many of us have differed in opinion, and we could find no man who could make the truth plain, but possibly a college, or an ecclesiastical council might.',
'I have not been able either to persuade my brother or to prevail on myself, to disuse the traffic or the potation of brandy, but perhaps a pledge of total abstinence might effectually restrain us.',
'The candidate my party votes for is not to be trusted with a dollar, but he will be honest in the Senate, for we can bring public opinion to bear on him.',
'Thus concert was the specific in all cases.',
'But concert is neither better nor worse, neither more nor less potent than individual force.',
'All the men in the world cannot make a statue walk and speak, cannot make a drop of blood, or a blade of grass, any more than one man can.',
'But let there be one man, let there be truth in two men, in ten men, then is concert for the first time possible; because the force which moves the world is a new quality, and can never be furnished by adding whatever quantities of a different kind.',
'What is the use of the concert of the false and the disunited?',
'There can be no concert in two, where there is no concert in one.',
'When the individual is not individual, but is dual;',
'when his thoughts look one way and his actions another;',
'when his faith is traversed by his habits;',
'when his will, enlightened by reason, is warped by his sense;',
'when with one hand he rows and with the other backs water, what concert can be?',
'I do not wonder at the interest these projects inspire.',
'The world is awaking to the idea of union, and these experiments show what it is thinking of.',
'It is and will be magic.',
'Men will live and communicate, and plough, and reap, and govern, as by added ethereal power, when once they are united;',
'as in a celebrated experiment, by expiration and respiration exactly together, four persons lift a heavy man from the ground by the little finger only, and without sense of weight.',
'But this union must be inward, and not one of covenants, and is to be reached by a reverse of the methods they use.',
'The union is only perfect when all the uniters are isolated.',
'It is the union of friends who live in different streets or towns.',
'Each man, if he attempts to join himself to others, is on all sides cramped and diminished of his proportion; and the stricter the union the smaller and the more pitiful he is.',
'But leave him alone, to recognize in every hour and place the secret soul; he will go up and down doing the works of a true member, and, to the astonishment of all, the work will be done with concert, though no man spoke.',
'Government will be adamantine without any governor.',
'The union must be ideal in actual individualism.',
'I pass to the indication in some particulars of that faith in man, which the heart is preaching to us in these days, and which engages the more regard, from the consideration that the speculations of one generation are the history of the next following.',
'In alluding just now to our system of education, I spoke of the deadness of its details.',
'But it is open to graver criticism than the palsy of its members: it is a system of despair.',
'The disease with which the human mind now labors is want of faith.',
'Men do not believe in a power of education.',
'We do not think we can speak to divine sentiments in man, and we do not try.',
'We renounce all high aims.',
'We believe that the defects of so many perverse and so many frivolous people who make up society, are organic, and society is a hospital of incurables.',
'A man of good sense but of little faith, whose compassion seemed to lead him to church as often as he went there, said to me that “he liked to have concerts, and fairs, and churches, and other public amusements go on.”',
'I am afraid the remark is too honest, and comes from the same origin as the maxim of the tyrant, “If you would rule the world quietly, you must keep it amused.”',
'I notice too that the ground on which eminent public servants urge the claims of popular education is fear; ‘This country is filling up with thousands and millions of voters, and you must educate them to keep them from our throats.’',
'We do not believe that any education, any system of philosophy, any influence of genius, will ever give depth of insight to a superficial mind.',
'Having settled ourselves into this infidelity, our skill is expended to procure alleviations, diversion, opiates.',
'We adorn the victim with manual skill, his tongue with languages, his body with inoffensive and comely manners.',
'So have we cunningly hid the tragedy of limitation and inner death we cannot avert.',
'Is it strange that society should be devoured by a secret melancholy which breaks through all its smiles and all its gayety and games?',
'But even one step farther our infidelity has gone.',
'It appears that some doubt is felt by good and wise men whether really the happiness and probity of men is increased by the culture of the mind in those disciplines to which we give the name of education.',
'Unhappily too the doubt comes from scholars, from persons who have tried these methods.',
'In their experience the scholar was not raised by the sacred thoughts amongst which he dwelt, but used them to selfish ends.',
'He was a profane person, and became a showman, turning his gifts to a marketable use, and not to his own sustenance and growth.',
'It was found that the intellect could be independently developed, that is, in separation from the man, as any single organ can be invigorated, and the result was monstrous.',
'A canine appetite for knowledge was generated, which must still be fed but was never satisfied, and this knowledge, not being directed on action, never took the character of substantial, humane truth, blessing those whom it entered.',
'It gave the scholar certain powers of expression, the power of speech, the power of poetry, of literary art, but it did not bring him to peace or to beneficence.',
'When the literary class betray a destitution of faith, it is not strange that society should be disheartened and sensualized by unbelief.',
'What remedy?',
'Life must be lived on a higher plane.',
'We must go up to a higher platform, to which we are always invited to ascend; there, the whole aspect of things changes.',
'I resist the skepticism of our education and of our educated men.',
'I do not believe that the differences of opinion and character in men are organic.',
'I do not recognize, beside the class of the good and the wise, a permanent class of skeptics, or a class of conservatives, or of malignants, or of materialists.',
'I do not believe in two classes.',
'You remember the story of the poor woman who importuned King Philip of Macedon to grant her justice, which Philip refused: the woman exclaimed, “I appeal:” the king, astonished, asked to whom she appealed: the woman replied, “From Philip drunk to Philip sober.”',
'The text will suit me very well.',
'I believe not in two classes of men, but in man in two moods, in Philip drunk and Philip sober.',
'I think, according to the good-hearted word of Plato, “Unwillingly the soul is deprived of truth.”',
'Iron conservative, miser, or thief, no man is but by a supposed necessity which he tolerates by shortness or torpidity of sight.',
'The soul lets no man go without some visitations and holydays of a diviner presence.',
'It would be easy to show, by a narrow scanning of any man’s biography, that we are not so wedded to our paltry performances of every kind but that every man has at intervals the grace to scorn his performances, in comparing them with his belief of what he should do;—',
'that he puts himself on the side of his enemies, listening gladly to what they say of him, and accusing himself of the same things.',
'What is it men love in Genius, but its infinite hope, which degrades all it has done?',
'Genius counts all its miracles poor and short.',
'Its own idea it never executed.',
'The Iliad, the Hamlet, the Doric column, the Roman arch, the Gothic minster, the German anthem, when they are ended, the master casts behind him.',
'How sinks the song in the waves of melody which the universe pours over his soul!',
'Before that gracious Infinite out of which he drew these few strokes, how mean they look, though the praises of the world attend them.',
'From the triumphs of his art he turns with desire to this greater defeat.',
'Let those admire who will.',
'With silent joy he sees himself to be capable of a beauty that eclipses all which his hands have done; all which human hands have ever done.',
'Well, we are all the children of genius, the children of virtue,—and feel their inspirations in our happier hours.',
'Is not every man sometimes a radical in politics?',
'Men are conservatives when they are least vigorous, or when they are most luxurious.',
'They are conservatives after dinner, or before taking their rest; when they are sick, or aged: in the morning, or when their intellect or their conscience has been aroused; when they hear music, or when they read poetry, they are radicals.',
'In the circle of the rankest tories that could be collected in England, Old or New, let a powerful and stimulating intellect, a man of great heart and mind, act on them, and very quickly these frozen conservators will yield to the friendly influence,',
'these hopeless will begin to hope,',
'these haters will begin to love,',
'these immovable statues will begin to spin and revolve.',
'I cannot help recalling the fine anecdote which Warton relates of Bishop Berkeley, when he was preparing to leave England with his plan of planting the gospel among the American savages.',
'“Lord Bathurst told me that the members of the Scriblerus club being met at his house at dinner, they agreed to rally Berkeley, who was also his guest, on his scheme at Bermudas.',
'Berkeley, having listened to the many lively things they had to say, begged to be heard in his turn, and displayed his plan with such an astonishing and animating force of eloquence and enthusiasm,',
'that they were struck dumb, and, after some pause, rose up all together with earnestness, exclaiming, ‘Let us set out with him immediately.’”',
'Men in all ways are better than they seem.',
'They like flattery for the moment, but they know the truth for their own.',
'It is a foolish cowardice which keeps us from trusting them and speaking to them rude truth.',
'They resent your honesty for an instant, they will thank you for it always.',
'What is it we heartily wish of each other?',
'Is it to be pleased and flattered?',
'No, but to be convicted and exposed, to be shamed out of our nonsense of all kinds, and made men of, instead of ghosts and phantoms.',
'We are weary of gliding ghostlike through the world, which is itself so slight and unreal.',
'We crave a sense of reality, though it come in strokes of pain.',
'I explain so,—by this manlike love of truth,—those excesses and errors into which souls of great vigor, but not equal insight, often fall.',
'They feel the poverty at the bottom of all the seeming affluence of the world.',
'They know the speed with which they come straight through the thin masquerade, and conceive a disgust at the indigence of nature: Rousseau, Mirabeau, Charles Fox, Napoleon, Byron,—',
'and I could easily add names nearer home, of raging riders, who drive their steeds so hard, in the violence of living to forget its illusion: they would know the worst, and tread the floors of hell.',
'The heroes of ancient and modern fame, Cimon, Themistocles, Alcibiades, Alexander, Caesar, have treated life and fortune as a game to be well and skilfully played, but the stake not to be so valued but that any time it could be held as a trifle light as air, and thrown up.',
'Caesar, just before the battle of Pharsalia, discourses with the Egyptian priest concerning the fountains of the Nile, and offers to quit the army, the empire, and Cleopatra, if he will show him those mysterious sources.',
'The same magnanimity shows itself in our social relations, in the preference, namely, which each man gives to the society of superiors over that of his equals.',
'All that a man has will he give for right relations with his mates.',
'All that he has will he give for an erect demeanor in every company and on each occasion.',
'He aims at such things as his neighbors prize, and gives his days and nights, his talents and his heart, to strike a good stroke, to acquit himself in all men’s sight as a man.',
'The consideration of an eminent citizen, of a noted merchant, of a man of mark in his profession;',
'a naval and military honor, a general’s commission, a marshal’s baton, a ducal coronet, the laurel of poets, and, anyhow procured, the acknowledgment of eminent merit,—',
'have this lustre for each candidate that they enable him to walk erect and unashamed in the presence of some persons before whom he felt himself inferior.',
'Having raised himself to this rank, having established his equality with class after class of those with whom he would live well, he still finds certain others before whom he cannot possess himself, because they have somewhat fairer,',
'somewhat grander,',
'somewhat purer, which extorts homage of him.',
'Is his ambition pure? then will his laurels and his possessions seem worthless:',
'instead of avoiding these men who make his fine gold dim,',
'he will cast all behind him and seek their society only, woo and embrace this his humiliation and mortification, until he shall know why his eye sinks, his voice is husky, and his brilliant talents are paralyzed in this presence.',
'He is sure that the soul which gives the lie to all things will tell none.',
'His constitution will not mislead him.',
'If it cannot carry itself as it ought, high and unmatchable in the presence of any man;',
'if the secret oracles whose whisper makes the sweetness and dignity of his life do here withdraw and accompany him no longer,—',
'it is time to undervalue what he has valued, to dispossess himself of what he has acquired, and with Caesar to take in his hand the army, the empire, and Cleopatra, and say, “All these will I relinquish, if you will show me the fountains of the Nile.”',
'Dear to us are those who love us;',
'the swift moments we spend with them are a compensation for a great deal of misery;',
'they enlarge our life;—but dearer are those who reject us as unworthy, for they add another life: they build a heaven before us whereof we had not dreamed, and thereby supply to us new powers out of the recesses of the spirit, and urge us to new and unattempted performances.',
'As every man at heart wishes the best and not inferior society, wishes to be convicted of his error and to come to himself,—so he wishes that the same healing should not stop in his thought, but should penetrate his will or active power.',
'The selfish man suffers more from his selfishness than he from whom that selfishness withholds some important benefit.',
'What he most wishes is to be lifted to some higher platform, that he may see beyond his present fear the transalpine good, so that his fear, his coldness, his custom may be broken up like fragments of ice, melted and carried away in the great stream of good will.',
'Do you ask my aid?',
'I also wish to be a benefactor.',
'I wish more to be a benefactor and servant than you wish to be served by me;',
'and surely the greatest good fortune that could befall me is precisely to be so moved by you that I should say, ‘Take me and all mine, and use me and mine freely to your ends’! for I could not say it otherwise than because a great enlargement had come to my heart and mind,',
'which made me superior to my fortunes.',
'Here we are paralyzed with fear; we hold on to our little properties, house and land, office and money, for the bread which they have in our experience yielded us, although we confess that our being does not flow through them.',
'We desire to be made great; we desire to be touched with that fire which shall command this ice to stream, and make our existence a benefit.',
'If therefore we start objections to your project, O friend of the slave, or friend of the poor, or of the race, understand well that it is because we wish to drive you to drive us into your measures.',
'We wish to hear ourselves confuted.',
'We are haunted with a belief that you have a secret which it would highliest advantage us to learn, and we would force you to impart it to us, though it should bring us to prison, or to worse extremity.',
'Nothing shall warp me from the belief that every man is a lover of truth.',
'There is no pure lie, no pure malignity in nature.',
'The entertainment of the proposition of depravity is the last profligacy and profanation.',
'There is no skepticism, no atheism but that.',
'Could it be received into common belief, suicide would unpeople the planet.',
'It has had a name to live in some dogmatic theology, but each man’s innocence and his real liking of his neighbor have kept it a dead letter.',
'I remember standing at the polls one day when the anger of the political contest gave a certain grimness to the faces of the independent electors,',
'and a good man at my side, looking on the people, remarked, “I am satisfied that the largest part of these men, on either side, mean to vote right.”',
'I suppose considerate observers, looking at the masses of men in their blameless and in their equivocal actions, will assent, that in spite of selfishness and frivolity, the general purpose in the great number of persons is fidelity.',
'The reason why any one refuses his assent to your opinion, or his aid to your benevolent design, is in you: he refuses to accept you as a bringer of truth, because, though you think you have it, he feels that you have it not.',
'You have not given him the authentic sign.',
'If it were worth while to run into details this general doctrine of the latent but ever soliciting Spirit, it would be easy to adduce illustration in particulars of a man’s equality to the Church, of his equality to the State, and of his equality to every other man.',
'It is yet in all men’s memory that, a few years ago, the liberal churches complained that the Calvinistic church denied to them the name of Christian.',
'I think the complaint was confession: a religious church would not complain.',
'A religious man like Behmen, Fox, or Swedenborg is not irritated by wanting the sanction of the Church, but the Church feels the accusation of his presence and belief.',
'It only needs that a just man should walk in our streets to make it appear how pitiful and inartificial a contrivance is our legislation.',
'The man whose part is taken and who does not wait for society in anything, has a power which society cannot choose but feel.',
'The familiar experiment called the hydrostatic paradox, in which a capillary column of water balances the ocean, is a symbol of the relation of one man to the whole family of men.',
'The wise Dandamis, on hearing the lives of Socrates, Pythagoras and Diogenes read, “judged them to be great men every way, excepting, that they were too much subjected to the reverence of the laws,',
'which to second and authorize, true virtue must abate very much of its original vigor.”',
'And as a man is equal to the Church and equal to the State, so he is equal to every other man.',
'The disparities of power in men are superficial; and all frank and searching conversation, in which a man lays himself open to his brother, apprises each of their radical unity.',
'When two persons sit and converse in a thoroughly good understanding, the remark is sure to be made, See how we have disputed about words!',
'Let a clear, apprehensive mind, such as every man knows among his friends, converse with the most commanding poetic genius, I think it would appear that there was no inequality such as men fancy, between them;',
'that a perfect understanding, a like receiving, a like perceiving, abolished differences;',
'and the poet would confess that his creative imagination gave him no deep advantage, but only the superficial one that he could express himself and the other could not;',
'that his advantage was a knack, which might impose on indolent men but could not impose on lovers of truth;',
'for they know the tax of talent, or what a price of greatness the power of expression too often pays.',
'I believe it is the conviction of the purest men, that the net amount of man and man does not much vary.',
'Each is incomparably superior to his companion in some faculty.',
'His want of skill in other directions has added to his fitness for his own work.',
'Each seems to have some compensation yielded to him by his infirmity, and every hindrance operates as a concentration of his force.',
'These and the like experiences intimate that man stands in strict connection with a higher fact never yet manifested.',
'There is power over and behind us, and we are the channels of its communications.',
'We seek to say thus and so, and over our head some spirit sits which contradicts what we say.',
'We would persuade our fellow to this or that; another self within our eyes dissuades him.',
'That which we keep back, this reveals.',
'In vain we compose our faces and our words; it holds uncontrollable communication with the enemy, and he answers civilly to us, but believes the spirit.',
'We exclaim, ‘There’s a traitor in the house!’ but at last it appears that he is the true man, and I am the traitor.',
'This open channel to the highest life is the first and last reality, so subtle, so quiet, yet so tenacious, that although I have never expressed the truth, and although I have never heard the expression of it from any other, I know that the whole truth is here for me.',
'What if I cannot answer your questions?',
'I am not pained that I cannot frame a reply to the question, What is the operation we call Providence?',
'There lies the unspoken thing, present, omnipresent.',
'Every time we converse we seek to translate it into speech, but whether we hit or whether we miss, we have the fact.',
'Every discourse is an approximate answer: but it is of small consequence that we do not get it into verbs and nouns, whilst it abides for contemplation forever.',
'If the auguries of the prophesying heart shall make themselves good in time, the man who shall be born, whose advent men and events prepare and foreshow, is one who shall enjoy his connection with a higher life, with the man within man;',
'shall destroy distrust by his trust, shall use his native but forgotten methods, shall not take counsel of flesh and blood, but shall rely on the Law alive and beautiful which works over our heads and under our feet.',
'Pitiless, it avails itself of our success when we obey it, and of our ruin when we contravene it.',
'Men are all secret believers in it, else the word justice would have no meaning: they believe that the best is the true; that right is done at last; or chaos would come.',
'It rewards actions after their nature, and not after the design of the agent.',
'‘Work,’ it saith to man, ‘in every hour, paid or unpaid, see only that thou work, and thou canst not escape the reward: whether thy work be fine or coarse, planting corn or writing epics,',
'so only it be honest work, done to thine own approbation, it shall earn a reward to the senses as well as to the thought: no matter how often defeated, you are born to victory.',
'The reward of a thing well done, is to have done it.’',
'As soon as a man is wonted to look beyond surfaces, and to see how this high will prevails without an exception or an interval, he settles himself into serenity.',
'He can already rely on the laws of gravity, that every stone will fall where it is due;',
'the good globe is faithful, and carries us securely through the celestial spaces, anxious or resigned, we need not interfere to help it on:',
'and he will learn one day the mild lesson they teach, that our own orbit is all our task, and we need not assist the administration of the universe.',
'Do not be so impatient to set the town right concerning the unfounded pretensions and the false reputation of certain men of standing.',
'They are laboring harder to set the town right concerning themselves, and will certainly succeed.',
'Suppress for a few days your criticism on the insufficiency of this or that teacher or experimenter, and he will have demonstrated his insufficiency to all men’s eyes.',
'In like manner, let a man fall into the divine circuits, and he is enlarged.',
'Obedience to his genius is the only liberating influence.',
