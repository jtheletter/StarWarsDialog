'All right. I’m gonna turn over the next card.',
'I want you to concentrate. I want you to tell me… what you think it is.',
'Square.',
'Good guess. But wrong.',
'Ah!',
'Clear your head.',
'All right. Tell me what you think it is.',
'Is it a star?',
'It is a star. Very good. That’s great.',
'Okay. All right.',
'Think hard. What is it?',
'Circle.',
'Oo… Close. But definitely wrong.',
'Oh!',
'Okay… All right. Ready?',
'Yeah.',
'All right.',
'What is it?',
'Come on.',
'Figure eight.',
'Incredible. That’s five for five. You can’t see these, can you?',
'No, no.',
'You’re not cheating me, are you?',
'No, I swear they’re just coming to me.',
'Okay… Nervous?',
'Yes… I don’t like this.',
'You only have 75 more to go, okay? What’s this one?',
'It’s… It’s… It’s a couple wavy lines.',
'Sorry. This isn’t your lucky day.',
'I know. Uh! Um… Wait, ah, um… Wait, uh…! I…',
'Hey!! I’m getting a little tired of this!',
'You volunteered, didn’t you? We’re paying, aren’t we?',
'Yeah, but I didn’t know you were gonna give me electric shocks!',
'What are you trying to prove here, anyway?!',
'I’m studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.',
'The effect?! I’ll tell you what the effect is! It’s pissing me off!',
'Well, then maybe my theory is correct!',
'You can keep the five bucks! I’ve had it.',
'I will, mister!',
'You may as well get used to that.',
'It’s the kind of resentment that your ability will provoke in some people.',
'Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?',
'You’re no fluke, Jennifer.',
'This is it! This is definitely it!',
'Did those UV lenses come in for the video camera? And that blank tape, I need it, the one you erased yesterday.',
'Will you excuse me for a second?',
'Sure.',
'I’m right in the middle of something, Ray.',
'Uh, I need more time with this subject. Could you come back in an hour, hour and a half?',
'Peter, at 1:40 p.m., at the main branch of The New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso, vaporous apparition.',
'It blew books off shelves from 20 feet away and scared the socks off some poor librarian.',
'I’m very excited. I’m very pleased. I want you to get right down there, check it out, and get back to me, okay—',
'No, no—',
'Get right back to me—',
'No. Peter, you’re coming with us on this one.',
'Spengler went down there. He took PKE valences, went right off the top of the scale. Buried the needle.',
'We’re close on this one. I can feel it.',
'I can feel it. We’re very, very close.',
'I have to go now, Jennifer. But I’d like to work with you some more. Perhaps you could come back this evening, say at—',
'8:00?',
'I was just going to say, “8:00?” You are a legitimate phenomenon.',
'As a friend, I have to tell you you finally gone around the bend on this ghost business.',
'You guys have been running your ass off, meetin’ and greetin’ every schizo in the five boroughs who says he has a paranormal experience—what have you seen?',
'Of course, you forget, Peter: I was present at an undersea, unexplained mass sponge migration.',
'Oh… Ray, the sponges migrated about a foot an’ a half.',
'Ooo… Ooo… Egon…',
'Oh, you’re here!',
'Yeah, what have you got?',
'This is big, Peter. This is very big. There’s definitely something here.',
'Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head. Remember that?',
'That would’ve worked if you hadn’t stopped me.',
'Hello. I’m Roger Delacorte. Are you the men from the university?',
'Yes. I’m Dr. Venkman. Dr. Stantz. Egon.',
'Thank you for coming. I hope we can clear this up quickly and… quietly.',
'Let’s not rush things. We don’t even know what you have yet.',
'I don’t remember seeing any legs, but it definitely had arms, because it reached out for me.',
'Arms?! I can’t wait to get a look at this thing.',
'Alice, I’m gonna ask you a couple of standard questions, okay?',
'Have you or any member of your family ever been diagnosed schizophrenic, mentally incompetent?',
'My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.',
'I’d call that a big yes.',
'Uh… Are you habitually using drugs, stimulants, alcohol?',
'No.',
'No, no. Just asking.',
'Are you, Alice, menstruating right now?',
'What has that got to do with it?',
'Back off, man. I’m a scientist.',
'Ray! It’s moving! Come on.',
'Look!',
'This is hot, Ray.',
'Symmetrical book-stacking. Just like the Philadelphia Mass Turbulence of 1947.',
'You’re right, no… human being would stack books like this.',
'Listen! You smell something?',
'Talk about telekinetic activity. Look at this mess!',
'Raymond, look at this.',
'Ectoplasmic residue!',
'Venkman, get a sample of this.',
'It’s the real thing.',
'Somebody blows their nose, and you wanna keep it?',
'I’d like to analyze it.',
'There’s more over here!',
'I’m getting stronger readings here.',
'Oh, ah… Aw… Oh… Ah…!',
'This way.',
'Come on!',
'Egon. Your mucus.',
'Eee!',
'This happen to you before?',
'Huh. First time.',
'It’s here.',
'(A full-torso apparition. And it’s real.)',
'So what do we do?',
'Could you come over here and talk to me for a second, please?',
'Could you just come over here for a second, please?',
'Right over here. (Come here, Francine. Come here.)',
'What do we do?!',
'(I don’t know. What do you think?)',
'Stop that!',
'We’ve got to make contact. One of us should actually try to speak to it.',
'Good idea.',
'Hello. I’m Peter. Where are you from? Originally.',
'Shhh.',
'All right. Okay. The usual stuff isn’t working.',
'Okay. I have a plan. I know exactly what to do.',
'(Now stay close. Stay close.)',
'(I know. Do exactly as I say.)',
'(Get ready. Ready?)',
'Get her!',
'Aargh!!',
'Oh! Ohh!!',
'You see it?! What was it?!',
'We’ll get back to you!',
'What?!',
'Hee hee hee… “Get her!”',
'That was your whole plan, “Get her.”',
'It was scientific.',
'I—I just got overexcited.',
'But wasn’t it incredible, Pete? I mean, we actually touched the etheric plane. You know what this could mean to the university?',
'Yeah, it’s gonna be bigger than the microchip. Ray, I’m very excited.',
'I wouldn’t say the experience was completely wasted.',
'According to these readings, I think we have an excellent chance of actually catching a ghost and holding it indefinitely.',
'Well, this is great. If the ionization rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities, we could really bust some heads!',
'In a spiritual sense, of course.',
'Spengs, you serious about this catching a ghost?',
'I’m always serious.',
'Egon, I’m gonna take back some of the things I’ve said about you.',
'You—You’ve earned it.',
'The possibilities are unlimitless—Hey, Dean Yeager!',
'I trust you’re moving us to better quarters on campus.',
'No, you’re being moved off campus.',
'The board of regents has decided to terminate your grant. You are to vacate these premises immediately.',
'This is preposterous. I demand an explanation.',
'Fine… This university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group’s activities.',
'But the kids love us.',
'Dr. Venkman. We believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.',
'You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle.',
'Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe. Your methods are sloppy. And your conclusions are highly questionable.',
'You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman.',
'I see.',
'And you have no place in this department… or in this university.',
'This is a major disgrace. Forget MIT or Stanford now. They wouldn’t touch us with a ten-meter cattle prod.',
'You’re always so concerned about your reputation. Einstein did his best stuff when he was a patent clerk.',
'You know how much a patent clerk earns?',
'No!',
'Personally, I liked the university. They gave us money and facilities. We didn’t have to produce anything.',
'You’ve never been out of college. You don’t know what it’s like out there.',
'I’ve worked in the private sector. They expect results.',
'For whatever reasons, Ray, call it… fate, call it luck, call it karma…',
'I believe that everything happens for a reason. I believe that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump.',
'For what purpose?',
'To go into business for ourselves.',
'This ecto-containment system that Spengler and I have in mind is gonna require a load of bread to capitalize. Where are we gonna get the money?',
'I don’t know. I don’t know.',
'You’re never gonna regret this, Ray.',
'My parents left me that house. I was born there.',
'You’re not gonna lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.',
'But at 19%? You didn’t even bargain with the guy.',
'Ray, for your information, the interest rate alone for the first five years comes to $95,000.',
'Will you guys relax? We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade: professional paranormal investigations and eliminations.',
'The franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams.',
'There’s office space, sleeping quarters, and showers on the next floor. And there’s a full kitchen on the top level.',
'It just seems a little pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity, that’s all.',
'What do you think, Egon?',
'I think this building should be condemned.',
'There’s metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members. The wiring is substandard. It’s completely inadequate for our power needs. And the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone.',
'Hey, does this pole still work?!',
'Wow! This place is great! When can we move in?! You gotta try this pole! I’m gonna get my stuff!',
'Hey! We should stay here—tonight! Sleep here! You know, to try it out!',
'I think we’ll take it.',
'Good.',
'Oh, hi.',
'Oh, Dana, it’s you.',
'Oh, hi, yes, Louis. It’s me.',
'I thought it was the drugstore.',
'Oh, are you sick?',
'Oh, no, no, I’m fine, I feel great. Just ordered some more vitamins and stuff.',
'I was just exercising. I taped “:20 Minute Workout” on my machine and played it back at high speed, so it only took ten minutes. I got a great workout.',
'Good…',
'You want to come in for a mineral water or somethin’?',
'Oh, I’d really like to, um, Louis, but I have to go to rehearsal now, excuse me.',
'No sweat. I’ll take a rain check on that. I always have plenty of low-sodium mineral water and other nutritious foods in the house. But you already know that.',
'Yeah, I know that.',
'Listen, that reminds me. I’m having a big party for all my clients. It’s my fourth anniversary as an accountant, you know. And even though you do your own tax return—which you shouldn’t do—I’d like you to stop by, bein’ that you’re my neighbor and all.',
'Well, thank you, Louis. I’ll really try to stop by.',
'Listen, that reminds me. You shouldn’t leave your TV on so loud when you go out. The creep down the hall phoned the manager.',
'That’s strange. I didn’t realize I left it on.',
'Oh, yeah. You know what I did? I climbed on the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable, but I couldn’t get in. So you know what I did? I turned up my TV real loud too—',
'Bye, Louis.',
'—so everyone would think both our TVs had somethin’ wrong with them.',
'Okay, so, I’ll see you later, huh? I’ll give you a call.',
'I gotta have a shower.',
'Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?',
'Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?',
'Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter, or ghost?',
'If the answer is yes, then don’t wait another minute.',
'Pick up your phone and call the professionals.',
'Ghostbusters.',
'Our courteous and efficient staff is on call twenty-four hours a day to serve all your supernatural-elimination needs.',
'We’re ready to believe you!',
'Oh!',
'Zuul!!',
'Aaah!!',
'You don’t think it’s too subtle, Marty? You don’t think people are gonna drive down and not see the sign?',
'You can’t park that here!',
'Everybody can relax, I found the car.',
'Needs some suspension work… and shocks and, uh, brakes, brake pads, linings, steering box, transmission, rear end…',
'How much?',
'Only 4800.',
'Maybe new rings, also mufflers, a little wiring…',
'Janine, any calls?',
'No.',
'Any messages?',
'No…',
'Any customers?',
'No, Dr. Venkman.',
'It’s a good job, isn’t it?',
'Type something, will you? We’re paying for this stuff.',
'Don’t stare at me. You’ve got the… bug eyes.',
'Janine? Sorry about the “bug eyes” thing. I’ll be in my office.',
'You’re very handy. I can tell.',
'I bet you like to read a lot too.',
'Print is dead.',
'Oh, that’s very fascinating to me. I read a lot myself. Some people think I’m too intellectual. But I think it’s a fabulous way to spend your spare time.',
'I also play racquetball. Do you have any hobbies?',
'I collect spores, molds, and fungus.',
'Hello?',
'Oh, excuse me. Is this—this is the Ghostbusters’ office?',
'Yes, it is. Can I help you?',
'I don’t have an appointment. I’d like to talk to someone, please.',
'I’m Peter Venkman. May I help you?',
'Um… Well, uh… I don’t know. I—What I have to say may sound a little unusual.',
'Oh, it’s all we get, day in, day out, around this place.',
'Come into my office, Miss…',
'Uh, Barrett. Dana Barrett.',
'And this voice said “Zuul”. And then I slammed the refrigerator door, and I left. That was two days ago, and I—I haven’t been back to my apartment.',
'Generally, you don’t see that behavior in a major appliance. What do you think it was?',
'Well, if I knew what it was, I wouldn’t be here.',
'Egon, what do you think?',
'She’s telling the truth. At least she thinks she is.',
'Well, of course I’m telling the truth! Wha—Who would make up a story like that?',
'Some are people who just want attention. Others—just nutballs who come in off the street.',
'You know what it could be? Past-life experience intruding on present time.',
'Could be a race memory stored in the collective unconscious. I wouldn’t rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.',
'I’m sorry, I don’t believe in any of those things.',
'Well, that’s all right. I don’t either.',
'But there are some things we do—standard procedures—in a case like this, which often bring us results.',
'Well, I could go to Hall of Records and check out the structural details in the building. Eh, maybe the building itself has a history of psychic turbulence.',
'Right. Good idea.',
'I could search “Zuul” in the usual literature.',
'“Spates’ Catalogue”.',
'“Tobin’s Spirit Guide”.',
'Yeah.',
'Tell you what. I’ll take Miss Barrett back to her apartment and check her out.',
'I’ll go check out Miss Barrett’s apartment.',
'Okay?',
'Okay… Thank you.',
'It’s okay.',
'Please, let me. If something’s gonna happen here, I want it to happen to me first.',
'That’s the closet.',
'They hate this. I like to torture ‘em.',
'That’s right, boys. It’s Dr. Venkman!',
'Lot of space. Just you?',
'Yes.',
'Good.',
'What is that thing you’re doing?',
'It’s technical. It’s one of our little toys.',
'I see.',
'That’s the bedroom. But nothing ever happened in there.',
'What a crime.',
'You know, you don’t act like a scientist.',
'They’re usually pretty stiff.',
'You’re more like a game-show host.',
'That’s the kitchen, huh?',
'Dana. Are these the eggs?',
'Yes. See, I was over there, and these eggs jumped out of their shells and started to cook on the counter.',
'That is weird.',
'And that’s when I started to hear that awful noise coming from the refrigerator.',
'Dr. Venkman, you’ve come all this way, would you like to check the refrigerator?',
'Better check the fridge. Good call.',
'Oh, my God. Look at all the junk food.',
'No! God damn it! Look, this wasn’t h—!',
'You actually eat this stuff?',
'Look, this wasn’t here, there was nothing here! There was a space, and there was a—a building or something with flames coming out of it! And there were creatures writhing around, and they were growling and snarling! And there were flames, and I heard a voice say, “Zuul”!',
'It was right here.',
'I’m sorry, I’m not getting any reading.',
'Well, are you sure you’re using that thing correctly?',
'Well, there’s n—I think so. But I’m sure there are no animals in there.',
'Well, that’s great. Either I have a monster in my kitchen, or I’m completely crazy.',
'I don’t think you’re crazy.',
'Oh, good. That makes me feel so much better.',
'Let me tell you something about myself! I come home from work to my place, and all I have is my work! There’s nothing else in my life!',
'Dr. Venkman—',
'I meet you, and I say, “My God, there’s someone with the same problem I have.”',
'Yes, we both have the same problem: you.',
'I’m gonna go for broke.',
'I am madly in love with you.',
'I don’t believe this. Will you please leave?',
'And then she threw me out of her life.',
'She thought I was a creep. She thought I was a geek, and she probably wasn’t the first.',
'You are so odd.',
'No.',
'I’ve got it!',
'No, no, no, no.',
'I’ll prove myself to you.',
'That’s not necessary.',
'Yeah, I’ll solve your little problem.',
'Okay.',
'And then you’ll say, “Pete Venkman’s a guy who can get things done.”',
'Right.',
'“I wonder what makes him tick.”',
'I wonder.',
'“I wonder if he’d be interested in knowing what makes me tick.”',
'Right…',
'I’ll bet you’re gonna be thinking about me after I’m gone.',
'I bet I am.',
'No kiss?',
'To our first customer.',
'To our first and only customer.',
'I’m gonna need to draw some petty cash. I should take her out to dinner, we don’t want to lose her.',
'Uh, this magnificent feast here represents the last of the petty cash.',
'Hey, slow down. Chew your food.',
'Hello, Ghostbusters.',
'Yes, of course they’re serious.',
'You do?',
'You have?',
'No kidding!',
'Uh-huh. Well, just, uh, just give me the address.',
'Yes, of course. Oh, they’ll be totally discreet.',
'Thank you.',
'We got one!!',
'It’s a call!',
'Come on!',
'Hey, anybody see a ghost?!',
'Uh, thank you for coming so quickly.',
'Jeez—!',
'The guests are asking questions, and I’m running out of excuses.',
'Has it happened before?',
'Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor.',
'Uh-huh.',
'The disturbances, I mean.',
'Yeah…',
'But it’s been quiet for years—up until two weeks ago.',
'It was never, ever this bad, though.',
'Yeah.',
'Did you ever report it to anyone?',
'No! Heavens, no.',
'No!',
'The owners don’t like us to even talk about it.',
'No.',
'I hoped we could take care of this quietly.',
'It’s done.',
'Tonight.',
'Yes, sir. Don’t worry. We handle this kind of thing all the time.',
'What are you supposed to be, some kind of a cosmonaut?',
'Ha. No, we’re exterminators. Somebody saw a cockroach up on twelfth.',
'That’s gotta be some cockroach.',
'Bite your head off, man.',
'Going up?',
'I’ll take the next one.',
'You know, it’s just occurred to me, we really haven’t had a completely successful test of this equipment.',
'I blame myself.',
'So do I.',
'Ah, no sense worrying about it now.',
'Why worry? Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back.',
'Yep. Let’s get ready. Switch me on.',
'What the hell are you doin’?',
'Sorry.',
'Sorry!',
'I’m sorry.',
'We thought you were someone else.',
'Successful test.',
'I guess so. Ah… I think we’d better split up.',
'Good idea.',
'Yeah. We can do more damage that way.',
'Venkman? Venkman!',
'Disgusting blob. I’m gonna have to hold him myself.',
'Come in, Ray.',
'Venkman! I saw it! I saw it! I saw it!',
'It’s right here, Ray. It’s looking at me.',
'He’s an ugly little spud, isn’t he?',
'I think he can hear you, Ray.',
'Don’t move. It won’t hurt you.',
'Aah! Ah! Aaah!',
'Venkman! Venkman! Pete!',
'Venkman, what happened? Are you okay?',
'He slimed me.',
'That’s great! Actual physical contact! Can you move?',
'Ray, Ray! Come in, please!',
'I feel so funky.',
'Spengler! I’m with Venkman! He got slimed!',
'That’s great, Ray. Save some for me.',
'Get down here, right away! It just went into a ballroom.',
'Okay, we’ll be right there.',
'Okay, sir. If you and your staff could please wait out here, we’ll take care of everything.',
'There it is! On the ceiling!',
'That’s the one that got me.',
'All right, boys. Ready? Throw it!',
'I did that! I did that! That’s my fault!',
'It’s okay. The table broke the fall.',
'There’s something very important I forgot to tell you.',
'What?',
'Don’t cross the streams.',
'Why?',
'It would be bad.',
'I’m fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing. What do you mean, “bad”?',
'Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.',
'Total protonic reversal.',
'Right, that’s bad. Okay, all right, important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.',
'All right—Ray, take the left. Egon, take the right.',
'‘Kay, Ray, give me one high and outside.',
'Ray!',
'Egon!',
'Okay, all right, all right, hold, hold, hold, oh, oh, oh, oh…!',
'Nice shootin’, Tex!',
'I assure you, Mrs. Van Hoffman, there is no problem with the room. It will be ready promptly at time as soon as your guests are with us.',
'The last throw took something out of him, but he’s gonna move!',
'I need some—I need some room to put the trap down! Give me some room!',
'You’ll excuse me, please.',
'We gotta get this in the clear.',
'Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!',
'I always wanted to do this. And…',
'The flowers are still standing!',
'Okay, on my go-signal.',
'Spengler. I want a confinement stream from you, okay? Go!',
'Okay. Hold him up there! He’s gonna move. Hold him up. Go!',
'It’s working, Ray.',
'Start bringin’ him down. Start bringin’ him down. You got him. Don’t cross the stream.',
'Maybe now you’ll never slime a guy with a positron collider, huh?',
'Venkman, shorten your stream. I don’t want my face burned off.',
'All right, I’m opening the trap now. Don’t look directly into the trap.',
'I looked at the trap, Ray.',
'Turn your streams off as soon as I close the trap.',
'Get ready… I’m closing it… Now!',
'It’s in there.',
'Hey!',
'Well, that wasn’t such a chore now, was it?',
'Mr. Smith, quickly. I want that door open now. Donald, stand over there.',
'We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!',
'Did you see it? What is it?',
'We got it!',
'What is it? Will there be any more of them?',
'Sir, what you had there was what we refer to as a focused, non-terminal, repeating phantasm, or a class-five, full-roaming vapor. Real nasty one too.',
'And now… let’s talk seriously.',
'Now, for the entrapment, we’re gonna have to ask you for four big ones, $4,000 for that.',
'But we are having a special this week on proton charging and storage of the beast. And that’s only gonna come to $1,000, fortunately.',
'$5,000? I had no idea it’d be so much. I won’t pay it.',
'Well, that’s all right. We can just put it right back in there. Thank you.',
'Well, we certainly can, Dr. Venkman.',
'No, no, no, no! All right! Anything.',
'Thanks so much.',
'Thank you. Hope we can help you again.',
'Coming through! One class-five, free-roaming vapor…!',
'Good morning, I’m Roger Grimsby. Today the entire eastern seaboard is alive with talk of incidents of paranormal activity.',
'Alleged ghost-sightings and related supernatural occurrences have been reported across the entire tri-state area. Seems everybody…',
'Well, everybody has heard ghost stories around the campfire. Heck, my grandma used to spin yarns about a spectral locomotive that would rocket past the farm where she grew up. But now, as if some unforeseen authority…',
'Stand aside, please!',
'Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in topic today: ghosts and ghostbusting.',
'The controversy builds, more sightings are reported. Some maintain that these… professional paranormal eliminators in New York are the cause of it all.',
'I got it! I got it! Pete?! Ray?!',
'Still making headlines all across the country, the Ghostbusters are at it again. This time at the fashionable dance club The Rose.',
'The boys in gray slugged it out with a pretty pesky poltergeist, then stayed on to dance the night away with some of the lovely ladies who witnessed the disturbance.',
'This is Casey Kasem. Now, on with the countdown.',
'Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week!',
'No job is too big! No fee is too big!',
'Is it just a mist, or does it have arms and legs?',
'As they say in TV, um, I’m sure there’s one big question on everybody’s mind, and I imagine you are the man to answer that:',
'How is Elvis, and have you seen him lately?',
'Do you believe in UFOs, astral projections, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster, and the theory of Atlantis?',
'Uh, if there’s a steady paycheck in it, I’ll believe anything you say.',
'I gotta get some sleep. I’m dying.',
'You don’t look good.',
'I don’t?',
'Well, you looked better. You didn’t used to look like this.',
'Yes, can—can you hold, please?',
'Here’s the paper on the Brooklyn. She paid with Visa.',
'Here’s tonight’s worksheet.',
'Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.',
'This is Winston Zeddemore. He’s here about the job.',
'Beautiful. You’re hired. Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.',
'Congratulations.',
'Can you help me, please?',
'Welcome aboard.',
'I don’t know where they get these guest conductors. I’m mean, someone should tell them it’s not gonna do him much good to scream at us in German.',
'Well, I don’t think that the man is competent to conduct a major symphony orchestra.',
'Um, could you wait here a minute?',
'Huh? Uh, sure.',
'Dr. Venkman, this is a surprise.',
'That was a wonderful rehearsal.',
'You heard that?',
'Yes. You’re the best one in your row.',
'Oh, thank you. You’re good. Most people can’t hear me with the whole orchestra playing.',
'Ah, I don’t have to take this abuse. I got hundreds of people dying to abuse me.',
'I know. You’re a big celebrity now. Do you have some information for me on my case?',
'Who’s the stiff?',
'The stiff happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world.',
'Do you have information for me, please?',
'Well, sure, but I prefer to give it to you in private.',
'Why don’t you tell me now?',
'Well, okay. I found the name Zuul for ya.',
'Well, the name Zuul refers to a demigod worshiped around 6000 BC by the… What’s that word?',
'“Hittites”.',
'Hittites, Mesopotamians, and Sumerians.',
'“Zuul was the minion of Gozer.” What’s Gozer?',
'Gozer was very big in Sumeria. Big guy.',
'Well, what’s he doing in my icebox?!',
'I’m working on that. If we could get together Thursday night, I’m thinking nine-ish, you know, we could exchange information.',
'I can’t see you Thursday. I’m… I’m… I’m busy.',
'Miss Barrett, you seem to think there is something wrong up here that says in your mind, “He enjoys taking his evenings off and spending it with his clients.”',
'No. I’m making a special exception in your case because… I respect you. It’s corny, but I respect you as an artist.',
'And as a dresser too. This is a magnificent coordination you have going here today.',
'Oh, God. Okay. I’ll, uh… I’ll see you Thursday.',
'I’ll bring the “Roylance Guide”, and we’ll eat and read.',
'So who the hell is that?',
'He’s just a friend.',
'A friend?',
'An old friend.',
'Ah, well, I’ll see you Thursday!',
'I’m sorry I didn’t get to meet you, sir! I’m glad you’re feeling much better! You’re still very pale, though! A little sun!',
'Well, what does he do?',
'Well, he’s a—a scientist.',
'This is where we store all the vapors and entities and slimers that we trap. Very simple, really.',
'A loaded trap here. Open, unlock the system. Insert the trap. Release. Close, lock the system. Set your entry grid. Neutronize your field. And…',
'The light is green, trap is clean. Ghost is incarcerated here in our custom-made storage facility.',
'There’s a man from the EPA here to see you. He’s waiting in your office.',
'EPA? What’s he want?',
'I don’t know. All I do know is I’ve been working two weeks without a break, and you promised me you’d hire more help.',
'Janine, someone with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top-flight job in either the food service or housekeeping industries.',
'Are you gonna answer that?',
'I’ve quit better jobs than this.',
'Ghostbusters! What do you want?',
'Can I help you?',
'I’m Walter Peck. I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, the Third District.',
'Great. How’s it going down there?',
'Are you Peter Venkman?',
'Yes, I’m… Dr. Venkman.',
'Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?',
'Well, I have Ph.D.’s in parapsychology and psychology.',
'I see. And now you catch ghosts.',
'Yeah, you could say that.',
'And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?',
'I’m not at liberty to say.',
'And where do you put these ghosts… once you catch them?',
'Into a storage facility.',
'And would this storage facility be located on these premises?',
'Yes.',
'And may I see… this storage facility?',
'No.',
'And why not, Mr. Venkman?',
'Because you did not use the magic word.',
'What is… the magic word, Mr. Venkman?',
'“Please”.',
'May I please… see the storage facility, Mr. Venkman?',
'Why do you want to see the storage facility?',
'Well, because I’m curious.',
'I want to know more about what you do here.',
'Frankly there’ve been a lot of wild stories in the media, and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation.',
'For instance, the presence of noxious, possibly hazardous waste chemicals in your basement.',
'Now you either show me what is down there, or I come back with a court order.',
'You go get a court order, and I’ll sue your ass for wrongful prosecution!',
'You can have it your way, Mr. Venkman.',
'I’m worried, Ray. It’s crowded in there, and all my data points to something big on the horizon.',
'What do you mean, uh, “big”?',
'Well, let’s say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York Area.',
'According to this morning’s sample, it would be a Twinkie… 35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds.',
'That’s a big Twinkie.',
'We could be on the verge of a fourfold cross-rip, a PKE surge of incredible, even dangerous proportions.',
'We just had a visit from the Environmental Protection Agency. How’s the grid holdin’ up?',
'It’s not good.',
'Tell him about the Twinkie.',
'What about the Twinkie?',
'Oh, Dana, it’s you!',
'Hello, Louis.',
'You gotta come in here, you’re missin’ a classic party!',
'Yes, well, I would, Louis, but I have a date coming.',
'You made a date… tonight?',
'Well, I’m—I—I’m sorry, Louis. I forgot.',
'Aw, that’s okay. You can bring him along.',
'All right, maybe we’ll stop by, okay?',
'That’s great! I’ll tell everybody you’re coming! We’re gonna play Twister, we’re gonna do some break-dancin’.',
'Hey, e—',
'Hey, let me in! It’s Louis! Somebody, let me in!!',
'Hello?',
'Oh, hi, Mom, uh… I’ve been busy.',
'Well, uh, no, everything is fine.',
'Yeah, no, just, uh, that one time.',
'Oh, I am.',
'I will.',
'I won’t. Mom, um, I have to go. I have a date.',
'Yes. No, uh, no one you know. It’s, uh…',
'Well, he’s, uh, he’s a Ghostbuster.',
'Those guys on TV.',
'Yes, well, I’ll have to let you know.',
'Okay. Love to Dad.',
'Right. Bye. Bye.',
'Oh, shit.',
'Oh—aaah!! Aaah!! Aaaah!!',
'Do you have any Excedrin or Extra Strength Tylenol?',
'Oh, gee. I think all I got is acetylsalicylic acid, generic. See, I can get 600 tablets of that for the same price as 300 of the name brand.',
'That makes good financial sense, good advice.',
'Hey, this is real smoked salmon from Nova Scotia, Canada, 24.95 a pound. It only cost me 14.12 after tax, though.',
'I’m giving this as a promotional expense. That’s why I invited clients instead of friends. You havin’ a good time, Marv?',
'How you doing? Why don’t you have some of the Brie? It’s at room temperature.',
'You think it’s too warm in here for Brie?',
'Louis, I’m going home.',
'Oh, don’t leave yet. Listen, maybe if we start dancing other people will join in.',
'Okay.',
'Oh, don’t move. I just got to get the door.',
'Ted! Annette!',
'Hi.',
'Hello, Lewis.',
'Glad you could come. How you doin’? Give me your coats.',
'Everybody, this is Ted and Annette Fleming.',
'How are you?',
'Ted has a small carpet-cleaning business in receivership. Annette’s drawing a salary from a deferred bonus from two years ago.',
'They got 15,000 left on the house at eight percent. So they’re okay!',
'So does anybody want to play Parcheesi?',
'Okay, who brought the dog?',
'Ah!',
'Oh!',
'Help! There’s a bear loose in my apartment! Help! Help!! Help!!',
'What?',
'A bear in his apartment!',
'I’m gonna bring this up at the tenants’ meeting. There’s not supposed to be any pets in the building.',
'Let me in. There’s gotta be a way in here. I gotta get in.',
'Please! Somebody! Let me in!',
'Nice doggy. Cute little pooch. Maybe I got a Milk-Bone.',
'Aargh!!',
'Hey, what happened?',
'Some moron brought a cougar to a party, and it went berserk.',
'Hi, I’m going up to Dana Barrett’s. Okay.',
'Hello?',
'That’s a different look for you, isn’t it?',
'Are you the Keymaster?',
'Not that I know of.',
'Are you the Keymaster??',
'Yes… I’m a friend of his. He told me to meet him here.',
'I didn’t get your name.',
'I am Zuul. I am the Gatekeeper.',
'Oh…',
'What are we doin’ today, Zuul?',
'We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.',
'Gozer, huh?',
'The Destructor.',
'Are we still going out?',
'You know, you could pick up the place if you’re expecting someone.',
'Do you want this body?',
'Is this a trick question?',
'I guess the roses worked, huh?',
'Take me now… sub-creature.',
'We never talk anymore.',
'Whoa—! Ooh! Easy…',
'I make it a rule… never to get involved with possessed people.',
'Mmm… Mmm… Mmm…! Heh…',
'Actually, it’s more of a guideline than a rule.',
'You know, I can—',
'I want you inside me.',
'Hah hah hah… Go ahead—! No, I can’t.',
'Sounds like you got at least two people in there already. Might be a little crowded.',
'Come on, I—I—Why don’t you just quit tryin’ to… upset and disturb… Dr. Venkman—and just relax.',
'Lie down there… Relax… And put your hands on your chest…',
'What I’d really like to do is talk to Dana. I want to talk to Dana.',
'Dana, it’s Peter.',
'There is no Dana. There is only Zuul.',
'Oh, Zuulie, you nut.',
'Now come on, come on. I want to talk to Dana. Dana. Just relax. Come on. Dana, Dana. Can I talk to Dana?',
'There is no Dana—only Zuul!',
'What a lovely singing voice you must have.',
'Now I’m gonna count to three, Zuulie. And if I don’t talk to Dana, there’s gonna be some real trouble in this apartment, I think.',
'One…',
'Two…',
'Two and a half…!',
'Please come down.',
'I am the Keymaster! The Destructor is coming. The Traveler, the Destroyer.',
'Gatekeeper!',
'I am Vinz. Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer. Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?',
'Hey, he pulls the wagon, I make the deals. You want a ride?',
'Wait for the sign. Then all prisoners will be released.',
'You will perish in flame, you and all your kind! Gatekeeper!',
'What an asshole.',
'Dropping off or picking up?',
'Dropping off.',
'Just a moment.',
'You a Ghostbuster?',
'Yes.',
'We picked up this guy. Now we don’t know what to do with him. Bellevue doesn’t want him. And I’m afraid to put him in the lockup. And I know you guys are into this stuff, so I figured we’d check with you.',
'All right.',
'Are you the Gatekeeper?',
'You better bring him inside.',
'You are so kind to take care of that man. You know, you are a real humanitarian.',
'I don’t think he’s human.',
'What did you say your name was?',
'Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.',
'According to this, his name’s Louis Tully. Lives on Central Park West.',
'Do you want some, uh, coffee, Mr. Tully?',
'Do I?',
'Yes, have some.',
'Yes, have some!',
'Vinz. You said before you were waiting for a sign. What sign are you waiting for?',
'Gozer the Traveler. He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms.',
'During rectification of the Vuldronaii, the Traveler came as a large and moving Torb!',
'Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the Meketrex supplicants, they chose a new form for him, that of a giant Sloar!',
'Many Shubs and Zulls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Sloar that day, I can tell you.',
'Egon.',
'Excuse me.',
'There’s something very strange about that man!',
'Listen, I’m usually very psychic, and I have a terrible feeling that something awful is gonna happen to ya.',
'I’m afraid you’re gonna die.',
'I’ll get it.',
'Hello?',
'Egon. It’s Peter.',
'Thanks, I’ve got it.',
'I have news from the world of Gozer.',
'What is it, Peter?',
'I’m here with Dana Barrett. It seems the Goze has been putting some moves on my would-be girlfriend.',
'How is she?',
'I think we can get her a guest shot on “Wild Kingdom”.',
'I just whacked her up with about 300 cc’s of Thorazine. She’s gonna take a little nap now.',
'But, uh, she says she’s the Gatekeeper. Does that make any sense to you?',
'Some.',
'I just met the Keymaster. He’s here with me now.',
'Oh, wonderful. We have to get these two together.',
'I think that would be extraordinarily dangerous.',
'Okay, well, hold onto him. I’ll be there in a little while.',
'Good.',
'Thank you, Vinz.',
'We have to find Ray. I need him here immediately.',
'Bad news, honey. I gotta go to work. Hey, will you stay here in bed until I get back?',
'Hey, Ray. Do you believe in God?',
'Never met him.',
'Yeah, well, I do. And I love Jesus’s style, you know?',
'This roof cap is made of a magnesium–tungsten alloy.',
'What are you so involved with there?',
'These are blueprints for the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett’s apartment, and they’re very, very strange.',
'Hey, Ray. Do you remember something in the Bible about the last days, when the dead would rise from the grave?',
'I remember Revelations 7:12.',
'“And I looked as he opened the sixth seal. And behold, there was a great earthquake. And the sun became as black as sackcloth. And the moon became as blood.”',
'“And the seas boiled. And the skies fell.”',
'Judgment Day…',
'Judgment Day.',
'Every ancient religion has its own myth about the end of the world.',
'Myth?! Ray, has it ever occurred to you that maybe the reason we’ve been so busy is because the dead have been rising from the grave?',
'How about a little music?',
'Heh. Yeah.',
'This way.',
'Excuse me. Excuse me, just where do you think you’re going?!',
'Step aside, miss, or you’ll be arrested for interfering with a police office—',
'Oh, no! Hold on. I’ve seen TV. I know you can’t come in here without a warrant or a writ or something!',
'Cease-and-desist-all-commerce order, seizure of premises and chattels, ban on the use of public utilities for non-licensed waste handlers, and a federal entry-and-inspection order!',
'Vinz, there’s one more test I’d like to perform—',
'Egon! I tried to stop them! He says they have a warrant.',
'Excuse me, this is private property.',
'Shut this off. Shut these all off.',
'I’m warning you, turning off these machines would be extremely hazardous.',
'I’ll tell you what’s hazardous. You’re facing federal prosecution for at least a half a dozen environmental violations. Now either you shut off these beams, or we shut ‘em off for you.',
'Try to understand, this is a high-voltage laser containment system. Simply turning it off would be like dropping a bomb in the city.',
'Don’t patronize me! I’m not grotesquely stupid, like the people you bilk.',
'At ease, officer. I’m Peter Venkman. I think there’s just been a slight misunderstanding, and I want to cooperate in any way that I can.',
'Forget it, Venkman. You had your chance to cooperate, but you thought it’d be more fun to insult me. Well, now it is my turn, wise-ass.',
'He wants to shut down the protection grid, Peter.',
'You shut that thing down, and we are not gonna be held responsible for whatever happens—',
'On the contrary, you’re gonna be held—',
'No, we won’t be held responsible—',
'Shut it off!',
'Don’t shut it off. I’m warning ya.',
'Um, I’ve—I’ve never seen anything like this. I don’t know—',
'Yeah, I’m not interested in your opinion. Just shut it off.',
'My friend, don’t be a jerk.',
'Step aside!',
'If he does that again, you can shoot him.',
'You do your job, pencil-neck. Don’t tell me how to do mine!',
'Thank you, officer.',
'Shut it off!',
'Oh, shit…',
'Clear the building!!',
'This is it! This is the sign!',
'Yeah, it’s a sign, all right! We’re goin’ out of business.',
'There it is, up there.',
'Yo, officer, what’s goin’ on…?',
'What happened?',
'Storage facility blew. He shut off the protection grid.',
'Oh, great.',
'That’s bad, isn’t it?',
'Yeah.',
'Where’s the Keymaster?!',
'Oh, shit!',
'Who’s the Keymaster?',
'Oh, come on!',
'Hold it!! I want this man arrested!!',
'Captain, these men are in criminal violation of the Environmental Protection Act!! And this explosion is a direct result of it!!',
'Your mother!!',
'Hey! Come on, hold it! Hold it! Come on, you…!',
'Columbia Building, 57th Street. I’m in a hurry, so, uh, let’s not dawdle.',
'Hey, guard! Look, I want to make a phone call.',
'Hey, I just work with these guys, man, I wasn’t even there!',
'The structure of this roof cap is exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker that NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in deep space.',
'Cold-riveted girders… with cores of pure selenium.',
'Everybody getting this so far?!',
'So what? I guess they just don’t make ‘em like they used to, huh?',
'No! Nobody ever made them like this!',
'I mean, the architect was either a certified genius or an authentic wacko.',
'Ray. For a moment… pretend that I don’t know anything about metallurgy, engineering, or physics, and just tell me what the hell is going on.',
'You never studied.',
'The whole building is a huge super-conductive antenna that was designed and built expressly for the purpose of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence.',
'Your girlfriend lives in the corner penthouse of spook central.',
'She’s not my girlfriend.',
'I find her interesting because she’s a client, and because she sleeps above her covers. Four feet above her covers.',
'She barks. She drools. She claws.',
'It’s not the girl, Peter. It’s the building.',
'Something terrible is about to enter our world, and this building is obviously the door.',
'The architect’s name was Ivo Shandor. I found it in “Tobin’s Spirit Guide”.',
'He was also a doctor. Performed a lot of unnecessary surgery.',
'And then in 1920, he started a secret society.',
'Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.',
'Right.',
'No studying.',
'After the First World War, Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.',
'And he wasn’t alone, he had close to a thousand followers when he died.',
'They conducted rituals up on the roof. Bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world. And now it looks like it may actually happen.',
'So be good! For goodness sake! Whoa, oh! Somebody’s comin’! Somebody’s comin’…!',
'We have to get out of here. We’ve got to find a judge or something here.',
'Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold it!',
'Now are we gonna go before a federal judge and say that some moldy Babylonian god is gonna drop in on Central Park West and start tearing up the city?!',
'Sumerian, not Babylonian.',
'Yeah, big difference.',
'Heh. No offense, but I gotta get my own lawyer.',
'Okay, Ghostbusters. Mayor wants to see you guys.',
'Whole island’s goin’ crazy. Let’s go.',
'I gotta split, the mayor wants to rap with me about some things.',
'I am the Keymaster.',
'I am the Gatekeeper.',
'Back. Stay back. Stay back.',
'I got a city blowing up, and you guys are not giving me any answers.',
'All right, we’re blocking the bridges, the roads…',
'The Ghostbusters are here, Mr. Mayor.',
'The Ghostbusters. Okay, the Ghostbusters.',
'Hey. Where’s this Peck?',
'I am Walter Peck, sir. And I’m prepared to make a full report.',
'These men are consummate snowball artists. They use sense and nerve gases to induce hallucinations.',
'People think they’re seeing ghosts. And they call these bozos, who conveniently show up to deal with the problem with a fake, electronic light show.',
'Everything was fine with our system until the power grid was shut off by dickless here.',
'They caused an explosion!',
'Is this true?',
'Yes, it’s true. This man has no dick.',
'You—!',
'Hey, no—!',
'Knock it off! Hey!',
'Break it up! Break it up!',
'All right! All right! All right!',
'Well, that’s what I heard!',
'This is City Hall!',
'Now what am I gonna do here, John?! What is this?!',
'All I know is that was no light show we saw this morning.',
'I’ve seen every form of combustion known to man. But this beats the hell out of me.',
'The walls in the 53rd Precinct were bleeding. How do you explain that?',
'Good afternoon, gentlemen.',
'Oh, Your Eminence.',
'Ah…',
'How are ya, Lenny?',
'You’re lookin’ good, Mike. We’re in a real fix here. What do you think I should do?',
'Lenny. Officially, the church will not take any position on the religious implications of these, uh, phenomena.',
'Personally, Lenny… I think it’s a sign from God. But don’t quote me on that.',
'Now, I think that’s a smart move, Mike.',
'Well, I’m not gonna call a press conference and tell everyone to start praying.',
'Uh… I’m, uh, Winston Zeddemore, Your Honor.',
'Look, I’ve only been with the company for a couple weeks. But I gotta tell you, these things are real.',
'Since I joined these men, I have seen shit that’ll turn you white.',
'Well, you could believe Mr. Pecker—',
'My name is Peck.',
'—Or you could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.',
'What do you mean, “biblical”?',
'What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.',
'Yes.',
'Real wrath-of-God–type stuff.',
'Exactly.',
'Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies! Rivers and seas boiling!',
'Forty years of darkness! Earthquakes! Volcanoes!',
'The dead rising from the grave!',
'Human sacrifice! Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!',
'Enough! I get the point!',
'But what if you’re wrong?',
'If I’m wrong, nothing happens! We go to jail—peacefully, quietly—we’ll enjoy it!',
'But if I’m right… and we can stop this thing… Lenny…',
'You will have saved the lives… of millions of registered voters.',
'I don’t believe you’re seriously considering listening to these men.',
'Get him outta here.',
'Bye.',
'I’ll fix you, Venkman. I’m gonna fix you.',
'I’m gonna get you a nice fruit basket—I’m gonna miss him!',
'All right, all right.',
'We got work to do. Now what do you need from me?',
'Come on, let’s run some red lights!',
'Hello, New York!',
'Hello, everybody! Whoa!',
'Dr. Ray Stantz, would you please? The heart of the Ghostbusters. Thank you.',
'They love you. They love you here.',
'I like that shirt, friend.',
'Ghostbusters! All right! All right…!',
'Gotta run! Got a date with a ghost!',
'Okay, whatever happens, let’s be professional!',
'We might have to put a little overtime in on this one!',
'Aaaah…!',
'Ghostbusters… Are they all right…?',
'Wait… There they are! Yeah!',
'I was in no way prepared for that!',
'It’s all right! Don’t worry, we’re fine, we can handle it, we can take it! They want to play rough!',
'Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters…!',
'Wanna play rough?!',
'Yeah!',
'Let’s do it!',
'Where are we?',
'It looks like we’re in the… teens… somewhere.',
'Well, when we get to twenty, tell me. I’m gonna throw up.',
'Twenty-two. Is this it?',
'Yup.',
'Art deco. Very nice.',
'Where is it?',
'It’s at the end of the hall.',
'Hey, where do these stairs go?!',
'They go up.',
'Okay, go ahead. Come on, go ahead. Watch it. Go ahead.',
'Dana!',
'Okay. So… she’s a dog.',
'It’s a girl.',
'It’s Gozer.',
'I thought Gozer was a man.',
'It’s whatever it wants to be.',
'Well, whatever it is, it’s gotta get by us!',
'Right.',
'Go get her, Ray!',
'Gozer the Gozerian?',
'Good evening.',
'As a duly designated representative of the City… County, and State of New York, I order you to cease any and all supernatural activity and return forthwith to your place of origin, or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension.',
'That ought to do it. Thanks very much, Ray.',
'Are you a god?!',
'…No.',
'Then… die!!',
'Aargh!!',
'Ray. When someone asks you if you’re a god, you say, “yes”!',
'All right. This chick is toast!',
'Got your stick?',
'Holdin’ it!',
'Heat ‘em up!',
'Smokin’!',
'Make ‘em hard!',
'Ready!',
'Let’s show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown.',
'Throw it!',
'Nimble little minx, in’t she?',
'We better go full-stream.',
'Aim for the flattop!',
'Wasn’t so hard.',
'We neutronized it! You know what that means? A complete particle reversal!',
'Eh, we had the tools! We had talent!',
'It’s Miller time!',
'Ray. This looks extraordinarily bad.',
'Oh, no.',
'What?',
'Look out!',
'Sub-creatures!!',
'Gozer the Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor, Volguus Zildrohar the Traveler has come!!',
'Choose and perish!!',
'What do you mean “choose”?! We don’t understand!',
'Choose!! Choose the form of the Destructor!!',
'Oh… I get it! I get it, oh! Very cute!',
'Whatever we think of—if we think of J. Edgar Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover will appear and destroy us, okay?',
'So empty your heads! Empty your heads! Don’t think of anything, we’ve only got one shot at this!',
'The choice is made!!',
'Whoa! Ho, huh? Whoa!',
'The Traveler has come!!',
'Nobody choosed anything!',
'Did you choose anything?!',
'No!',
'Did you?!',
'My mind is totally blank.',
'I didn’t choose anything!',
'I couldn’t help it.',
'It just popped in there.',
'What?! What just popped in there?!',
'I—I—I tried to think—',
'Look!!',
'No! It can’t be!',
'What is it?!',
'It can’t be!',
'What did you do, Ray?!',
'Ah, shit!',
'It’s the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.',
'Well, there’s somethin’ you don’t see every day.',
'I tried to think of the most harmless thing. Something I loved from my childhood. Something that could never, ever possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.',
'Nice thinkin’, Ray.',
'We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows… by the fire at Camp Waconda.',
'Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon. What have you got left?',
'Sorry, Venkman. I’m terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.',
'Oh, no.',
'Mother pus-bucket.',
'Nobody steps on a church in my town!',
'One… two… three… roast him!',
'Funny, us going out like this. Killed by a hundred-foot marshmallow man.',
'We’ve been goin’ about this all wrong. This Mr. Stay Puft is okay. He’s a sailor. He’s in New York. We get this guy laid, we won’t have any trouble.',
'I have a radical idea.',
'The door swings both ways. We could reverse the particle flow through the gate.',
'How?',
'We’ll cross the streams.',
'Excuse me, Egon. You said crossing the streams was bad.',
'Cross the streams…',
'You’re gonna endanger us. You’re gonna endanger our client—the nice lady who paid us in advance, before she became a dog.',
'Not necessarily. There’s definitely a very slim chance we’ll survive.',
'I love this plan! I’m excited to be a part of it! Let’s do it!',
'This job is definitely not worth eleven-five a year!',
'Hurry!',
'See you on the other side, Ray.',
'Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.',
'Let’s turn ‘em on, Spengler!',
'Spark ‘em now, Spengler!!',
'Aahhhhh…!!!',
'Winston… Are you all right?',
'Heh heh… Yeah… yeah…',
'Venkman? Spengler! Venkman! Spengler?',
'Oh, Spengler. Ah, are you okay?',
'I feel like the floor of a taxicab.',
'Venky!',
'Yeah, where are ya?',
'Oh, thank God. Oh. You okay?',
'I’m all right.',
'You all right?',
'I’m all right. You all right?',
'Yeah. You okay?',
'Fine.',
'Oh… Smells like barbecued dog hair.',
'Oh! Venkman. Oh, Venkman, I’m sorry. I’m sorry, I—I just—I just forgot.',
'Look!',
'Somebody turn on the lights! Help! Somebody…!',
'Go check on that little guy!',
'What happened?',
'Oh… Oh… Oh, where am I?',
'Oh… hi.',
'You’re all right.',
'Boy, the superintendent’s gonna be pissed!',
'Are you okay?',
'Who are you guys?',
'We’re the Ghostbusters.',
'Who does your taxes?',
'You know, Mr. Tully, you are a most fortunate individual.',
'I know.',
'You have been a participant in the biggest inter-dimensional cross-rip since the Tunguska Blast of 1909.',
'Felt great.',
'We’d like to get a sample of your brain tissue.',
'Okay.',
'I love this town!! Ha ha!',
'Written by DAN AYKROYD and HAROLD RAMIS',
'Egon! You’re safe!',
'What’s goin’ on?!',
'Anybody want to interview me? I’m an eyewitness! I was up—!',
'I want to go with them in the car.',
'Aah!',
'5 YEARS LATER',
'Here. You take this ticket! You can have this ticket and keep it! I’m not payin’ that ticket!',
'Jesus! Why don’t you watch where you’re going?!',
'…Then I want you to go downstairs to the cellar and check the water line to that boiler. Check the pump, all right? I wanna do that today, all right?! Could you do that?!',
'Rick? Would you mind giving me a hand with these?',
'Hey… I ain’t the doorman, Miss Barrett—I’m the buildin’ superintendent!',
'You’re also a human being.',
'Okay, it’s not my job. But what the hell, I’ll do you a favor.',
'Listen, when are you gonna get around to fixing the radiator in the baby’s room? You know, I asked you last week?',
'Didn’t I do that?',
'It’s getting really cold in there. I—I—I—I…',
'Okay. Well, it’s no problem.',
'Hey!',
'Hey! Stop that carriage!',
'Whoa!',
'Stop!',
'Get it!',
'That’s my baby!! Watch out!!',
'Jesus!!',
'Oscar!! Watch out!! My God!!',
'Please! Oh!',
'Stop that carriage!',
'Oh!',
'GHOSTBUSTERS II',
'How many of them are there?',
'Fourteen. They’re in here. I hope you can handle it. It’s been like a nightmare.',
'How big are they?',
'Hmm? Four feet.',
'Hey, hey, kids! Listen up, listen up! Look who’s here!!',
'Hey!',
'Boo!\nBooo!\nBoooo!',
'How you doing, kids?',
'Oh, I thought it was gonna be He-Man.',
'Yeah…\nYeah…',
'Hey, hey! I know. I know—Why don’t we all sit down, and we’ll have fun!',
'Yeah!',
'You know, my dad says you guys are full of crap.',
'Jason! Hush.',
'Well, some people have trouble believing in the paranormal.',
'No, he just says you’re full of crap, and that’s why you went out of business.',
'Song.',
'Come on, everybody!',
'…Ghostbusters! 🎶',
'There’s somethin’ strange… 🎼',
'In the neighborhood… 🎼',
'Who you gonna call? 🎼',
'He-Man!\nHe-Man!\nHe-Man!\nHe-Man!',
'He-Man! He-Man! He-Man! He-Man! He-Man! He-Man! He-Man…!',
'And it don’t look good…',
'Let’s go get a beer, all right?',
'Yeah.',
'Thank you!',
'Bye.',
'Call anytime!',
'Look, that’s it. I’ve had it, Ray. No more parties.',
'Here’s your share.',
'Look, I’m tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.',
'I know, Z, but we can’t quit now. The holidays are coming up. It’s our best season.',
'Ray. Man, face it. Ghostbusters doesn’t exist.',
'A year from now, those kids won’t even remember who we are.',
'Ungrateful little yuppie larvae. After all we did for this city.',
'Yeah…',
'We conjured up a hundred-foot marshmallow man, blew the top three floors off an uptown high-rise, ended up gettin’ sued by every state, county, and city agency in New York.',
'Yeah… But what a ride.',
'…Went right out into the middle of traffic. And I started really running after it.',
'And then it just suddenly… stopped, right in the middle of the street.',
'Mmm-hmm. And did anyone else see this happen?',
'Well, sure, hundreds of people.',
'Egon, I didn’t imagine this.',
'I’m not saying you did. It’s just in science, we always look for the simplest explanation.',
'We’re ready, Dr. Spengler.',
'Good. We’ll start with the negative calibration.',
'What are you working on, Egon?',
'I’m trying to determine whether human emotions actually affect the physical environment.',
'It’s a theory Ray and I had when we were still Ghostbusters.',
'Can they see us?',
'No. They think they’re here for marriage counseling.',
'We kept them waiting for two and a half hours. And I’ve been gradually increasing the temperature in the room. It’s up to 95 degrees at the moment.',
'Now my assistant has asked them if they’d mind waiting another half hour.',
'Oh. Good. Very good. Very, very nice.',
'So, Egon, what do you think?',
'Excellent. Just excellent.',
'Do the happiness index next.',
'I mean… about the carriage.',
'Well, I’d like to bring Ray in on this, if you don’t mind.',
'Sure. Whatever you think.',
'But not Venkman.',
'Oh, no.',
'Do you ever see him?',
'Occasionally.',
'How is he these days?',
'Peter? Well, he was borderline for a while. Then he crossed the border.',
'Does he ever… mention me?',
'No.',
'Oh.',
'Well, we… we didn’t part on very good terms, and… Then we sort of lost track of each other, uh, after I got married.',
'We’re ready for the affection test.',
'Good, send in the puppy, please.',
'I thought of getting in touch with him after my marriage ended, but…',
'Oh. Hmm.',
'Isn’t that sweet?',
'I appreciate your doing this.',
'Try not to worry.',
'Here’s my phone number. You’ll call me?',
'Yes.',
'I’d rather you didn’t mention any of this to… Peter, if you don’t mind.',
'No, I won’t, I won’t.',
'Thanks.',
'Let’s see what happens when we take away the puppy.',
'…Father encouraged them…',
'Hi. Welcome back to “World of the Psychic”. I’m Peter Venkman.',
'I’m chatting with my guest: author, lecturer, and psychic, Milton Angland.',
'Milt, your new book is called “The End of the World”.',
'Now, can you tell us when it’s gonna be, or do we have to buy the book?',
'Well, I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve.',
'This year?',
'Mmm-hmm.',
'Well, that’s… cutting it a little bit close, isn’t it? I mean…',
'Just from a sales point of view, I mean, your book is just coming out, you’re not gonna see any paperback sales for at least a year.',
'It’ll be at least another year before you know whether you’ve got the mini-series or “Movie of the Week” kind of possibilities.',
'I mean, just—devil’s advocate, Milty.',
'I mean, shouldn’t you have said, “Hey, the world’s gonna end in 1992”?',
'Wait. Wait a minute.',
'Or better yet, 1994?',
'This—This is not just some money-making scheme, all right?!',
'I have a strong… psychic… belief… …that the world… will end… on… on New Year’s Eve.',
'Well, for your sake, I hope you’re right.',
'Okay. But I think my other guest may disagree with you.',
'Elaine. Now, you had another date in mind.',
'According to my source, the end of the world will be on February 14th, in the year 2016.',
'Valentine’s Day. Bummer.',
'Where’d you get your date, Elaine?',
'I received this information from an alien.',
'As I told my husband, it was in the Paramus Holiday Inn.',
'I was having a drink at the bar, alone, and this alien approached me.',
'He started talking to me. He bought me a drink.',
'And then… I think he must have used some kind of a ray or a mind-control device, because he forced me to follow him to his room.',
'And that’s where… he told me about the end of the world.',
'So your alien had a room at the Holiday Inn, Paramus?',
'It might’ve been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room at the Holiday Inn.',
'I can’t be sure about that, Peter.',
'Of course not. And that is the whole problem with aliens, is you just can’t trust ‘em.',
'Occasionally you meet a nice one: Starman, E.T.',
'But usually they turn out to be some kind of big lizard!',
'That’s all the time we’ve got for this week on “World of the Psychic”.',
'Next week, though…',
'(Give me Ira.)',
'Hairless pets. Weird.',
'Until then, this is Peter Venkman, saying…',
'Heh heh heh heh… See you then. Bye.',
'Norman, where do you find these people?',
'Weren’t we supposed to have the telekinetic guy who bends the spoons?',
'He canceled. This is the best we could do at such short notice.',
'Look, no respected psychic will come on the show. They think you’re a fraud.',
'I am a fraud.',
'Mr. Mayor. Lenny. Lenny!',
'Pete Venkman.',
'Can I help you?',
'Yeah. Get your hand off me.',
'Thank you, I’m an old friend of the mayor’s. I wanna say hello, give him a kiss.',
'I’m Jack Hardemeyer. I’m the mayor’s assistant.',
'I know who you are, Dr. Venkman. I just… don’t see any ghosts anywhere.',
'Ah, ha ha ha. Well, that’s why I wanted to talk to His Highness.',
'See, we did a little job for the city a while back, and we got stiffed on the bill by some bureaucratic bookworm like yourself.',
'Look, you stay away from the mayor. He’s running for governor next fall.',
'And the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.',
'You know, I’m a voter. Aren’t you supposed to lie to me and kiss my butt?',
'All right, yes. Now, I want you to put the Vigo in the arch. Under the arch there.',
'Everything you’re doing is bad. I want you to know this.',
'You be careful there, all right?',
'No one listens to me.',
'Well, Dana, how are you doing? How’s this Bonington coming?',
'Uh, it’s coming along fine. This mixture you gave me is working really well.',
'Yes? Well, I make pretty good cocktails, don’t I? Ah, heh.',
'Yes, you’re doing, eh, really quite good work there.',
'Thank you.',
'Think it won’t be long before, eh, you can, eh, assist me in, eh… more important restoration.',
'Just a… a white… white thing.',
'Well, thank you, Dr. Poha, um…',
'Eh, Janosz.',
'Janosz.',
'Um… I’ve enjoyed working here, but now that my baby’s a little older, I’m gonna try to go back to the orchestra.',
'Oh, I’m sorry to hear that—that you will not—not be—not here.',
'Well, uh, could I say goodbye? You know, eh, maybe bring you to a brunch today?',
'Well, I can’t today, I have an appointment.',
'In fact, I’d better go.',
'I don’t understand this.',
'You know, every day I say, “Well, dear, oh, can you do something?” You say, “No, I can’t do something.” You know, what, can—',
'Do I have, eh, bad breath or something?',
'Of course not.',
'All right. Well, I just give you a rain check.',
'I think that she likes me.',
'Ah, heh heh… No, I do. I truly do. Ah, heh heh heh…',
'This one’s interesting, Ray: Berlin, 1939. A flower cart took off by itself, rolled half a kilometer. Three hundred eyewitnesses.',
'My best to the coven.',
'Berlin, huh?',
'You know, we should also check Duke University’s mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.',
'I pulled it.',
'Uh, perhaps you could you help me.',
'I’m looking for a… love-potion aerosol that I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet to obtain her total submission.',
'Hello, Venkman.',
'Hi, Pete. How’s it going?',
'Very well. Hi, Egon. How’s school?',
'I bet those science chicks really dig that large cranium of yours, huh?',
'I think they’re more interested in my epididymis.',
'Heh.',
'Ray, let’s close this place up so you can buy me a calzone.',
'Well, I really can’t do that right now, Pete. I’m workin’ on something.',
'But your book came in. “Magical Paths to Fortune and Power”.',
'Thank you.',
'Wow, good luck with that, Venkman. Heh.',
'Will you put this on my account, please?',
'Sure.',
'Ray, take a look at this.',
'Oh, yeah.',
'What’re you guys workin’ on?',
'Uh, well, we’re just kind of—',
'Ahem.',
'—checking something out… for an old friend.',
'Neat. Who?',
'Um… Ope.',
'Ray’s Occult.',
'Seven o’clock on weekdays, midnight on Saturdays. Thank you.',
'Who…?',
'Who? Uh, just someone we know.',
'Ah, oh…',
'Who?',
'Oh!! I can’t! No! No! No! No! I…',
'Oh, yes, you can. Who?',
'Nobody! Nobody! Uh… I can’t, I… I can’t… Uh…',
'Can you tell me now? Now?',
'Dana Barrett!',
'Ow.',
'My Dana Barrett?',
'I’ll get it!',
'Hi, Dana.',
'Hi, Ray. How good to see you. Thanks for coming.',
'Hey, no problem. Always glad to help. And hug!',
'Hello, Dana.',
'Hi, Egon. Thanks a lot.',
'Nice place.',
'Um…',
'Well, I know I’m just asking for the big hurt, but I thought I’d give us one more chance.',
'He—He tortured me. He pulled my ears!',
'Hello, Peter.',
'Hello, Dana.',
'So what would you like to do first?',
'We’d like to examine the baby first.',
'He’s right here.',
'Yeah, and anything associated with the baby. Especially, uh, stuffed toys, things with fabrics and stuffing.',
'Okay.',
'Then we’d like to see the buggy.',
'All right. Can I put him over here maybe?',
'And, uh, wherever he sleeps.',
'Yes.',
'Um… This okay?',
'This will be fine, yes, that’s fine.',
'We’ll have to lay him down flat.',
'Okay, sweetheart. Now they’re gonna take a look at you.',
'We’ll do a cursory medical examination.',
'What do you say? Gammel and Pross Infant Acuity Test?',
'Sounds good. We’ll finish with an Apgar score.',
'Well, it’s nothing that’s gonna hurt him, right?',
'Hah! No…',
'No… No, I don’t think so. He’ll be fine.',
'You ever done this before?',
'On a chimp.',
'So, uh, whatever happened to Mr. Right, anyway? I heard he… ditched you and ran off to Europe.',
'He didn’t ditch me.',
'We had some problems, and… he got a very good job offer from an orchestra in London, and he took it.',
'So he ditched you.',
'Okay. Subject is a… male Caucasian. Approximately…',
'Twenty-four inches.',
'Twenty-four inches in, uh, length.',
'Uh, subject weighs approximately 18 pounds and is about eight months old.',
'Ah, okay. Ocular?',
'Uh, pupillary response normal.',
'Auditory.',
'Appears normal.',
'Ampullary reflex.',
'Uh, appears to be ticklish.',
'Yep. Baby ticklish.',
'You know, you’d have been better off marrying me.',
'You never asked me.',
'And whenever I brought it up, you’d get drowsy and fall asleep.',
'You never got it, Dana.',
'I’m a man! I’m sensitive! I need to feel loved! I need to be desired!',
'It was when you started introducing me as “the old ball and chain”. That’s when I left.',
'Well… I may have a lot of personal problems, but I’m a total professional when it comes to my job.',
'Egon.',
'What?',
'What are we doing?',
'He seems to be fine, Dana.',
'Mmm-hmm. He’s very healthy.',
'He’s okay.',
'When he does sleep, where do you put him?',
'Uh, right around here, I’ll show you.',
'Venkman, would you get a… stool specimen, please?',
'Business or personal?',
'It’s a little messy.',
'Well, we don’t wanna play with anything, we just wanna sweep for valences.',
'Hmm. Very cheerful. My parents didn’t believe in toys.',
'You wanna play with a big kid?',
'You know, I—I should have been your father. I mean, I could have been.',
'I understand.',
'Help! He’s gone completely berserk! Help! Help!',
'Uh-oh.\nUh-oh.',
'You mean, you never even had a Slinky?',
'We had part of a Slinky. But I straightened it.',
'Help! Help! Help me!',
'He, uh, he had some sort of a clear liquid coming out of his mouth too.',
'Yeah, well, that happens.',
'Well, what do you think?',
'Well, he’s ugly.',
'I mean, he’s not Elephant Man ugly, but… he’s not attractive. Was his father ugly?',
'Don’t listen.',
'And he stinks.',
'You’re ripe, señor!',
'Did his father stink?',
'Yeah. Daddy was a smelly, huh?',
'What’s your name?',
'His name is Oscar.',
'Oh… Named after a hot dog. You poor man. You poor, poor man.',
'But seriously, there’s nothing… unusual about him, is there?',
'Well, I don’t have a lot of experience with babies.',
'But you’re excited now, because Mama’s here to get your stool sample. Right, Mama?',
'Stool sample?',
'Yeah.',
'Nothin’.',
'So what, brainiac?',
'I’d like to run some gynecological tests on the mother.',
'Who wouldn’t?',
'Let’s check the street.',
'It stopped right over there… in the middle of the crosswalk.',
'All right, I can get us out there.',
'Hey. Venkman.',
'Hold on.',
'We’re scientists! Excuse us! Get out of the way!',
'Thanks a lot. Hey, we gotta do an inquiry here. Hold on!',
'Thanks. Appreciate it. Thanks.',
'You gonna move out of there or what?',
'Hey, relax, you’re on the meter.',
'Come on, hey! We’re scientists, get out of the way!',
'Oh, ho ho ho ho… I think we hit the honeypot.',
'There’s something brewing under the street. I’ve got one-one-eighteen on the PKE.',
'Two-point-five GEVs on the giga-meter.',
'Well, what does that mean?',
'Hey! How you doin’?',
'Me?',
'Yeah.',
'Fine, fine. It’s… cutting fine now.',
'Great. Why are you cutting?',
'Why am I cutting?',
'Yeah…',
'Boss!',
'Who told you to stop cuttin’?!',
'Somebody tell you to stop cut—?!',
'What’re you guys doin’ here?',
'You tell him to stop cutting?!',
'Yes, I told him to stop cutting. What are you doin’?',
'What’s it look like we’re doin’ here?! Why don’t you let us work?! We let you work!',
'Hey, take it easy—He’s been workin’ overtime.',
'I tell you why we’re here. We’re here because some diaper bag downtown is bein’ a jerk and makin’ us work on a Friday night.',
'Am I right, Peter?',
'Of course you’re right, Raymond. Is he right, Ziggy?',
'Yo.',
'Hee hee hee… Hee hee… Hee hee hee… Hee hee, yeah, right…',
'You guys take it easy, all right?',
'Come on… Come on… Come on…',
'How’s it going? What—What’ve you been doin’?',
'What have I been doing? While you were getting coffee for an hour? I’ve been digging a big hole in the middle of the street.',
'Wow… Wow…',
'Looks like you’ve uncovered an old air shaft.',
'Man, just goes on and on!',
'This is very intense. We should get a deeper reading.',
'Yeah. We’re gonna need a deeper reading.',
'Yeah, somebody has to go down there.',
'Yeah, somebody’s gotta go down there.',
'Ohh…! Stinging! I’m stinging!',
'Woah! Whew…',
'Listen to me.',
'What? Who?!',
'I, Vigo, the Scourge of Carpathia, the Sorrow of Moldavia, command you!',
'Oh! Command me, lord!',
'On a mountain of skulls, in the Castle of Pain, I sat on a throne of blood!',
'What was, will be! What is, will be no more!',
'Now is the Season of Evil!',
'Evil?',
'Find me a child, that I might live again!',
'Yes. A child. A child… A child?',
'Woo, woo, woo! Woo!',
'A child.',
'You all right?',
'Yeah, I’m good. Speed’s good, boys. Keep it comin’.',
'We’re breaking through. I see some light.',
'I’m in some kind of a chamber… There’s tile work…',
'Slime!',
'What?',
'It’s a river of slime!',
'There’s gotta be 25,000 gallons of it! It’s flowing through here like a river!',
'Van Horne. Pneumatic transit.',
'I can’t believe it! It’s the old pneumatic transit system, it’s still here!',
'Okay, whoa, whoa! That’s good, that’s good! Hold me up, hold me up! That’s good!',
'What do you see?',
'All right… Let’s see if I can get a sample…',
'What’s goin’ on here?! Hey! What’s the story?!',
'Hey, what, you boneheads are gonna come and roust me out again?!',
'I got three thousand phones out in Greenwich Village! I got about eight million miles of cable I gotta check!',
'You gonna come shake my monkey tree again?!',
'What are you talking about, buddy?! The phone lines are over there!',
'What did I say to you? The phone lines are over there!',
'Hey!',
'What did I say?! How many times?!',
'Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!',
'You’re not with Con Ed or the phone company. We checked. So tell me another one.',
'I’ve got a major gas leak here! Where do you think all this is comin’ from?! The sky?!',
'Uh, okay, boys. Boys?',
'Ah, pull me up now, all right?',
'There’s… some kind of activity… going on with this stuff…',
'Boys?! Hey, help! Take me up!',
'Ray!',
'Start it! Start it!',
'Boys?! Hey, what’s going on up there?!',
'Come on! Get me out of this hole! Ahh!',
'Sweetie… Hello…',
'Go back to sleep, darling.',
'Who is it?',
'It’s Janosz!',
'(Janosz!)',
'Hello, Janosz.',
'This is a… surprise.',
'Oh, eh… Hello. Uh, yes. Well, uh… I—uh—I happened to be he—here… in, uh, this… neighborhood, and I thought that I would stop by to see how—how is it with… you.',
'Yeah, because of all this, uh… blackness, it was.',
'Oh. We’re fine. Thank you. Thank—',
'Well, then, you’re okay.',
'Oh, eh, uh, how’s the, eh, baby?',
'Oh, he’s, he’s okay. Yes.',
'Uh… Woo-hoo?!',
'He’s, uh… sleeping.',
'Oh, but I wooed! Uh, hah…',
'That’s okay.',
'All right. Ah. Do you need anything? You know? Do you want me to come in?',
'No, thank you.',
'All… right. Just thought that I would check. You know. Well… Hey, you. Don’t let the bedbugs bite.',
'Good night, Janosz.',
'Before we begin this trial, I want to make one thing very clear.',
'The law does not recognize the existence of ghosts, and I don’t believe in them either.',
'I don’t want to hear a lot of malarkey about goblins, spooks, and demons.',
'We’re gonna stick to the facts in this case and leave the ghost stories to the kiddies, understood?',
'Wow, sounds like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?',
'Yeah, they call him “The Hammer”.',
'What can we do? It’s all in the hands of our lawyer now.',
'I think you guys are making a big mistake.',
'I do mostly tax law and some probate stuff occasionally.',
'I got my law degree at night school.',
'Well, that’s fine, Louis. We got arrested at night.',
'Look, just put these guys away fast and make sure they go away for a long, long time, okay?',
'I don’t think it’s gonna be hard, with this list of charges.',
'Good. Very good.',
'Violating a judicial restraining order, willful destruction of public property, fraud, malicious mischief…',
'Heh. See you in a couple of years… at your first parole hearing.',
'Hmm. You’ll never take us alive.',
'All right, all right. Let’s get on with it.',
'Your Honor…? Ladies and gentlemen of—of the—of the audience?',
'I don’t think it’s fair to call my clients frauds.',
'Okay, so the blackout was a big problem for everybody, okay?',
'I was stuck in an elevator for two hours, and I had to make the whole time.',
'But I don’t blame them. ‘Cause one time I turned into a dog, and they helped me. Thank you.',
'Very good, Louis. Short but… pointless.',
'Mr. Fianella. Please look at exhibits A through F on the table over here. Do you recognize this equipment?',
'Yeah. That’s the stuff the cops took from their truck.',
'Do you know what this equipment is used for?',
'Huh… I don’t know, uh… Catchin’ ghosts, maybe? I don’t know.',
'May I remind the court that the defendants are under a judicial restraining order that strictly forbids them from performing services as paranormal investigators or eliminators.',
'So noted.',
'Now, Mr. Fianella. Can you identify the substance in this jar marked “Exhibit F”?',
'Yeah. Yeah, that’s the stuff, all right.',
'Your Honor, I’ve been working underground for Con Ed for twenty-seven years. I never saw anything like this in my life.',
'Hmm.',
'Whatever’s down there, they must’ve put it there.',
'No, we didn’t!',
'Ray, Ray, Ray…',
'Shut up!',
'So—So—So—So you were just trying to help out a—',
'(…help a friend…)',
'—help out a friend—',
'(…who was frightened…)',
'—who was a-scared of what was happenin’ to her—',
'(…no evil intent…)',
'—and wh—when you’re scared—what?',
'(…there was no evil intent…)',
'There was no evil intent, no malice! Uh—uh—',
'(…because I live here…)',
'—because you live here, and when you live in a place, and you love it like you do, you don’t want nothin’ bad to happen—what?',
'(…it was an isolated incident, it’ll never happen, it was a one-shot, it was an isolated…)',
'Because it—it—it’ll never happen again! It’s an isolated incident! It’s a one-shot deal!',
'Objection, Your Honor!',
'What?',
'He’s leading the witness.',
'Sustained.',
'(Give me a break—we’re both lawyers!)',
'Mr. Tully. You have any questions for this witness that might have some bearing on this case?',
'Do I?',
'No, we’ve helped them out enough already.',
'No, Your Honor.',
'(Your witness!)',
'Dr. Venkman. Would you please tell the court why it is that you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a very big hole in the middle of First Avenue?',
'Well, there’s so many holes in First Avenue, we really didn’t think anyone would notice.',
'Keep that up, mister, I’ll find you in contempt.',
'I’m truly sorry, Your Honor.',
'I’ll ask you again, Dr. Venkman. Why were you digging the hole? And please remember you’re under oath.',
'There are some things in this world that go way beyond human understanding.',
'Things that cannot be explained, things that most people don’t wanna know about.',
'That is where we come in.',
'So what you’re saying is that the world of the supernatural is your exclusive province?',
'Kitten, I think what I’m saying is that sometimes shit happens, someone has to deal with it, and who you gonna call?',
'Yeah…! Woo…!',
'Shut up!',
'Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz, Egon Spengler, stand up! Get up!',
'You too, Mr. Tully.',
'I find you guilty on all charges!',
'I order you to pay fines in the amount of $25,000 each!',
'I sentence you to eighteen months in the city correctional facility at Riker’s Island.',
'Egie. She’s twitchin’.',
'I’m not finished!',
'On a more personal note, let me just go on record as saying that there’s no place for fakes, charlatans—',
'Uh, Your Honor?',
'Shut up!',
'Or tricksters like you in decent society!',
'Your Honor, this is important.',
'You play on the gullibility of innocent people!',
'Yes, sir.',
'Be quiet!',
'But…',
'If my hands weren’t tied by the unalterable fetters of the law, then I would invoke the tradition of our illustrious forebears, reach back to a purer, sterner justice, and have you… burned at the stake!',
'Wow!',
'Oh, my God, the Scoleri brothers.',
'Scoleri brothers!',
'Friends of yours?!',
'I tried them for murder! Gave them the chair!',
'You gotta do something!',
'Why don’t you just tell them you don’t believe in ghosts?',
'Oh—aaah…!',
'You gotta do something! Help me!',
'Don’t talk to me. Talk to my attorney.',
'That’s me! My guys are still under a judicial misstrangement order! That blue thing I got from her!',
'They could be exposing themselves!',
'And you don’t want us… exposing ourselves!',
'Ahhh…!',
'Ohhh…!',
'You’re next, bubbles.',
'All right, all right! I rescind the order! Case dismissed!',
'Hurray! We won the case—!',
'Now, do something!',
'Oh…! Oh…! I always hated this part of the business.',
'You know, it’s been a couple years since we used this stuff. I hope it still works.',
'It should. Power cells have a half-life of five thousand years.',
'There’s no time for a bench test. Heat ‘em up.',
'Doh…',
'Ray…',
'Egon…!',
'Whoa!',
'Aaahhhh…!',
'Uh, heh heh heh…',
'Ha. Ha.',
'You got him, Venkman! Hold him! Steady! Easy! Grab him!',
'Come on, big boy! I’m gonna take you home to my private zoo! Woo!',
'You got him! You got him!',
'Egie! Bring the trap!',
'Okay, okay!',
'Behind you! Ray!',
'Hold him, Ray!',
'Venkman! Start bringing him back!',
'Come on, you big meanie! Let’s go, chubby!',
'Ray, keep pulling him to the right!',
'Okay, the trap’s going in!',
'Now, now, now, Spengie!',
'Hold it, Ray!',
'Hit it!',
'Two in the box!',
'Ready to go!',
'We be fast.',
'And they be slow!',
'Wow.',
'We’re the best! We’re the beautiful! We’re the only… Ghostbusters.',
'We’re back!',
'Ghostbusters.',
'Yes, we’re back.',
'Certified check, cash, or money order!',
'Get him!',
'Bye-bye.',
'Ah! What is it, honey?!',
'It’s that darn ghost again! He just won’t leave—us alone!',
'I guess we’re just going to have to move!',
'No, wait! Don’t worry! We’re not moving! He is.',
'Who are you going to call?',
'Ghostbusters!',
'Now.',
'Janine, lunch!',
'Boy, it smells like somebody took a big…',
'Ahhh!',
'…With our special half-price service plan.',
'What?! Hold on! Half-price?! Have we all gone mad?!',
'I guess so, Pete. Because that’s not all. Tell them, Egon.',
'Oh. You mean the Ghostbusters hot-beverage thermal mug and free balloons for the kids?',
'We’ve been experimenting with the plasm we found in the subway tunnel.',
'Careful.',
'Should I get spoons?',
'Don’t bother. Watch this.',
'Go ahead, Ray.',
'You! You worthless piece of slime!',
'You ignorant, disgusting blob!',
'You’re nothing but an unstable short-chain molecule!',
'You foul, obnoxious muck!',
'You have a weak electrochemical bond!',
'I have seen some disgusting crud in my time, but you take the cake!',
'You’re a—you’re just—!',
'Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.',
'This is what you do with your spare time?',
'Peter. This is an incredible breakthrough.',
'I mean, what a discovery. A psycho-reactive substance.',
'Whatever this stuff is, it responds to human emotional states.',
'Mood slime.',
'Oh, baby.',
'You mean this stuff actually feeds on bad vibes.',
'Like a cop in a doughnut factory.',
'We’ve been running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.',
'What kind of tests?',
'Well… We sing to it, and, uh… we talk to it, and… say… supportive, nurturing… things to it.',
'You’re not sleeping with it, are you, Ray?',
'Oh, you…',
'It’s always the quiet ones.',
'You hound.',
'Ahem. How about the… kinetic tests?',
'Okay.',
'Ordinary household toaster.',
'We’ll take your word for that.',
'It responds to music, so we’ve been doing some experimentation, playing easy listening.',
'Middle-of-the-road–type stuff. You know, Paul Young, “Dust in the Wind”. That works okay. Dig this.',
'Works for me.',
'Loves Jackie Wilson.',
'Sheesh. You guys do this at night, when I’m not here?',
'Oh, I get it. It sings. It sounds exactly like Jackie. That’s fantastic.',
'Just watch.',
'Does it do Emmylou Harris?',
'Your love… lifting me higher… 🎶',
'Oh, it dances too.',
'Than I’ve ever… been lifted before… 🎶',
'Whoa!',
'So keep it up…! 🎶',
'Shake it up!',
'Quench my desire…! 🎶',
'And I’ll be at your side… 🎶',
'Hah hah hah! Oh! Oh, baby! Oh, you’re my number one Christmas boutique gift item.',
'Right, and the first time somebody gets mad, that toaster could eat their hand.',
'No, no, no, no. We put a warning label on it. We don’t have any liability.',
'Ah! Ow! Ow!',
'Oh, did you ever go for it! The old man-eating toaster bit.',
'Get him!!',
'Hello. I’m looking for Dana Barrett.',
'Room 304, Restoration.',
'Thank you.',
'Hey, uh… Dr. Venkman! “World of the Psychic”!',
'That’s right. How you doing?',
'I’m a big, big fan of yours.',
'Thank you very much. Thank you.',
'It used to be one of my two favorite shows.',
'You’re kidding me. Well, great. What was the other one?',
'“Bass Masters”. It’s a fishing show.',
'Yeah, I know “Bass Masters”. Sure.',
'You’re good, pretty eyes.',
'I didn’t paint it. I’m just cleaning it. It’s a Gauguin.',
'Oh, I’ve heard of him.',
'Uh… Heh heh… Hey, Dana. Aren’t you going to introduce me to your friend?',
'Um. Sure. Peter Venkman, this is, uh, Dr. Janosz Poha, the head of our department.',
'Yes, I have, of course, have seen you on the television. Quite enjoy.',
'Eh… You’re not here on business, I hope?',
'Well, it’s top-secret.',
'Say, Johnny, you got a Gauguin too.',
'No. Eh, actually, I’m preparing this portrait for the new Romantic exhibition.',
'Yes. This is Prince Vigo, the ruler of Carpathia and Moldavia.',
'Bit of a sissy, isn’t he?',
'He was a very powerful magician, Dr. Venkman. And a… a genius in many ways.',
'He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.',
'I hate this painting. I’ve felt uncomfortable ever since it came up from storage.',
'Well, you’re probably feeling what Vigo is feeling: Carpathian kitten loss. He’s missed his kitten.',
'We’ll just put one in here by the castle.',
'We don’t go around altering valuable artwork, Dr. Venkman!',
'Go! Yes, I think, go! Yes, the—the joyfulness is over!',
'He’s kidding.',
'Well, you’re not gonna get a green card with that attitude, pal. Okay?',
'I don’t know what t—oh, of course, of course.',
'I get it. You’re sweet on this hunky stud, aren’t you?',
'You know, Peter, every now and then I get the feeling that painting is watching me, even smiling at me.',
'You know, I think we got more food on your shirt than we did in your mouth.',
'It’s okay.',
'Bath. You get to take a bath, don’t you?',
'Yes, do your favorite thing.',
'Because I know what you get to do. You know what you get to do?',
'Do you know what’s more fun than anything? Huh?',
'Splash Mommy.',
'“I get to splash Mommy.” Yes.',
'I’m gonna be ready for mister.',
'Mommy’s gonna take her shirt off too.',
'Yes.',
'No! No!!',
'Peter, it’s me, please let us in!',
'What the hell is this?',
'Peter, let us in, please!',
'I didn’t know where else to go. The most awful thing happened.',
'The bathtub… The bathtub was trying to eat Oscar.',
'I was giving him a bath.',
'There was all this pink ooze everywhere, and it was reaching for him.',
'Okay, you’re all right. You’re all right, you’re okay.',
'I’m not gonna let ‘em get you.',
'All right, you’re all safe now, okay? Everybody’s fine now.',
'I was so terrified. Yes, darling. I’m so sorry.',
'Now you guys just, uh, sit down, relax, huh?',
'Come on. Just sit down. I’ll get you guys a shirt or something. Hold on.',
'Ray.',
'Yeah, Dana’s just come over to my place.',
'Well, actually, her tub tried to eat her.',
'What? Are you serious?',
'Well, that’s great!',
'I mean, that’s… terrible.',
'But it’s great for what we would—',
'Yeah, I will.',
'Yeah, sure, we’ll get right on it.',
'Spengler.',
'Major slime-related psychokinetic event.',
'What happened?',
'Something came out of Dana’s bathtub. Tried to grab her and the baby.',
'Are they all right?',
'Yeah, well, she got out of there and went over to Venkman’s.',
'This is interesting, Ray. Remember the painting Venkman mentioned?',
'Uh-huh.',
'Ran the name “Vigo the Carpathian” through the occult reference net. Look what came up.',
'Oo. Nice ugly history.',
'Do you think there’s a connection between this Vigo character and the… slime?',
'Is the atomic weight of cobalt 58.9?',
'We better get over to Dana’s apartment. I’d like to check out that bathtub.',
'It might be a good idea to go to the museum in the morning, get a look at that painting.',
'Ray’s gonna go on over to your place and just take a look.',
'He is?',
'Okay. I have been holding on to this for a long time, Oscar.',
'I got this… from a girl, who got this… from Joe Willie Namath, okay?',
'We don’t know how. We don’t wanna know.',
'So I would appreciate it if you would not hose this thing down, you know, give it your own personal rinse. Thank you.',
'Be an excellent time for you to start practicing a thing we big guys like to call “self-control”.',
'Get out of here.',
'Oh, look at him. Look at him. Oh, look at his gut.',
'Oh, he’s a coconut, this guy.',
'You’re gonna be staying at Uncle Pete’s until this thing blows over.',
'This is your place now.',
'Hi.',
'Come on in. This is my place.',
'So how are we gonna handle the sleeping arrangements?',
'Well, what’s best for me is if I lie on my side like this, and you spoon up beside me, your arm draped over me.',
'We do it the other way… I get your hair caught in my throat, and I choke in the night.',
'Well, how about you on the sofa and me and the baby in the bed?',
'It’s a way to go.',
'It’s so late. I really ought to put him down.',
'May I?',
'Yeah, if you want to.',
'You’re short. Your belly button sticks out too far. And you’re a terrible burden on your poor mother.',
'Did you find anything at Dana’s?',
'Eh, nothing but some mood-slime residue around the bathtub.',
'But I did get something on that Vigo character you mentioned.',
'Found it in Leon Zundinger’s “Magicians, Martyrs, and Madmen”. Dig that.',
'Yup. Vigo the Carpathian. Born 1505, died 1610.',
'A hundred and five years old. He hung in there, didn’t he?',
'He didn’t die of old age, either. He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn, and quartered.',
'Ouch.',
'I guess he wasn’t too popular at the end.',
'No, not exactly a man of the people.',
'Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy.',
'Wasn’t he also Vigo the Butch?',
'And dig this. There was a prophecy.',
'Just before his head died, his last words were:',
'“Death is but a door. Time is but a window. I’ll be back.”',
'(Let’s suck in the guts, guys. We’re the Ghostbusters.)',
'No! No, please, go, you! Yes, you…!',
'Who’s this wiggler?',
'He’s yours, Ray. Sic him.',
'I have—discussed—!',
'Hi, how are you? Ray Stantz from the Ghostbusters. Nice to see you.',
'Can I tell you—',
'Beautiful lab you have here. We’re just doin’ a routine spook check.',
'Eh—Dr. Venkman, Dana is not here.',
'Yeah, we know that, Johnny.',
'So why are you came?',
'Well, we got a report there was a major creep in the area, we checked our list, and you were right on the top.',
'Johnny, where in the hell are you from, anyway?',
'The Upper West Side.',
'Whole room’s extremely hot, Peter.',
'Ew, that’s one… ugly dude.',
'Hot?',
'Oh, that’s Vigo.',
'Mr. Vigo?! Vigs. Would you look this way, please?',
'Uh… Please. No, don’t. No. No. No! No photographs, please! Slides are available in the gift shop! Eh? Ahh—!',
'Yeah, thanks. Thank you, Winston.',
'All right. You know what? Give me angry, will you? Will you give me angry?',
'When you’ve had a bad day, you’re cranky.',
'Yeah, thank you. Good, good!',
'Oo, angrier. Oo!',
'I’m scared. You’re scaring me. Stop it.',
'Yeah… Good!',
'Okay, walk for me, talk for me, yeah, yeah, ha ha!',
'Okay, give me hot and sexy.',
'Can you do it? You can. Oh, boy. Show me some teeth. Come on.',
'I bet the girls like you, huh? Huh? Do the girls?',
'Do the guys? Bet they both do, huh? Huh?',
'What about the animals? They like you?',
'That’s it, more!',
'Yeah, come on! You’re big, you’re big!',
'All right, destroy me! Destroy me now, yeah! Destroy me! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, give it, give it! Yeah!',
'Venkman? Venkman? We need to talk. Come on.',
'I’ve worked with better. But not many. Thank you.',
'John, thanks.',
'Hey. Hey!',
'Huh?',
'Hey, you finished?',
'Yeah, I’m finished here.',
'Are you all right?',
'What?',
'I mean, you’re not coming down with something?',
'Huh, me?',
'Dana? Your prince!',
'Oh, no.',
'Oh, no. Oh, no.',
'She cleaned.',
'Hi.',
'Hi…',
'Shh. He’s asleep. Come here.',
'So what happened with my apartment?',
'Well. The guys spent the whole night there.',
'They went through all your things, your personal stuff.',
'Uh, they tried on some of your clothes, made some long-distance phone calls, uh, cleaned out the fridge…',
'Did they find anything?',
'They found a little bit of that pink slime.',
'Oh, God. Well, what am I supposed to do now?',
'You are supposed to get dressed and get crazy with me on the streets of Manhattan tonight. Let’s go.',
'Peter, I don’t think that—',
'This is exactly what you need. I have got you a babysitter. The whole thing’s wired.',
'I don’t think we should go out on a date, you know.',
'And I can’t leave Oscar in a strange place with a strange person.',
'Strange person? Janine Melnitz, from my staff.',
'Janine has experience babysitting?',
'Here.',
'Thank you.',
'I’ve also brought some things… from your apartment.',
'Some… wardrobe choices. A couple of… provocative ensembles in here. I’ll leave it up to you.',
'Okay, but after dinner… don’t put any of those old cheap moves on me, okay?',
'No, no, no, no…',
'It’s different.',
'I have all new cheap moves.',
'Hey, you! Hey, you! It looks like you’re awake, huh? You’re awake!',
'Yes, Osco. You’re gonna have the whole place to yourself tonight, pal.',
'It’s gonna be pretty neat.',
'I got some Laura Antonelli tapes, if you wanna watch them.',
'Dana, did you see some, uh… shirts here, in the floor/bed area?',
'Yeah, I put ‘em in the hamper.',
'I have a hamper?',
'Heh, it’s in the bathroom.',
'Neat.',
'Will you tell me next time you’re gonna do that, though, please?',
'Well, I thought they were dirty.',
'Hah. I have more than two grades of laundry, okay?',
'There’s not just clean and dirty. There are many subtle levels, okay?',
'You hang this outside the window for twenty minutes, it’s perfectly fine.',
'Interesting role model for you, Oscar, huh?',
'Well, they couldn’t get to you until after the New Year.',
'Well, just don’t go in there.',
'Louis! I’m closing up!',
'I don’t know, should I take the subway or… the surface roads or what? It’s kind of busy out.',
'Well, I’m walking. Good night!',
'Well, now. Well, well, well, hang on, now. Do… Do you maybe wanna—Oh, no. No…',
'Do you wanna have something to eat with me?',
'Well… Yeah, I’d love that. But I—I—I—I told Dr. Venkman I’d babysit for him.',
'Oh, well…',
'Do you wanna babysit with me?',
'Okay, I would.',
'Great. His place at 8.',
'Bye.',
'His place at 8. All right. Well, I can get his address from the W2—',
'Hey, buddy, move it!',
'We were right, Ray. Multi-planar Kirlian emanations.',
'Yeah, well, here’s your next month’s cover of GQ.',
'Check out the aura on this sucker.',
'Now, there’s definitely a living presence there.',
'We should get a deeper look.',
'Why don’t I run this wider shot through the spectral analyzer.',
'Good, I’ll try turning up the roentgens.',
'So what do you think? Chinese?',
'Uh… How about Thai?',
'No, that’s too spicy. Greek?',
'Uh… Mexican?',
'Pizza.',
'Thin or thick?',
'Chicago.',
'What the hell is that?',
'I know what it is.',
'I’ve seen it before.',
'Where?',
'When you guys had me dangling like a worm on a hook a hundred feet below First Avenue.',
'That’s the river of slime.',
'Wha—!',
'Uh… Ray.',
'We need a blanket or a hose or somethin’!',
'Get out.',
'What?! Why is this closed?',
'Winston! Winston!',
'Hey! Fire!',
'Back away, back away.',
'What are we gonna do, put our heads in the toilet?',
'Taxi!',
'Pete, it’s great that you’re here. We’ve got incredible news.',
'Wait a minute. Can I have one try?',
'All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?',
'No. We analyzed the photos you took of Vigo. The spectrogram shows a river of slime flowing behind him.',
'Just like the one I saw underground. Now we’re going into the subway and sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the flow.',
'Yeah, come on. Change your clothes. We’ll wait for you.',
'Yeah, Egon thinks there might even be a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.',
'Hi, boys. What’s up?',
'Hi.',
'Dana, the guys are going down into the sewer to check for slime stuff.',
'And Egon thinks there may even be a huge surge in cockroach breeding.',
'Wanna blow off this dinner thing and go with them?',
'Taxi!',
'Women, huh?',
'Oh!',
'Uh!',
'Ah!',
'Will you watch your step?',
'I hate this.',
'According to this old transit map, there should be an entrance anywhere along here somewhere.',
'I’m not getting anything yet.',
'Well… at least it’s too dark to see the cockroaches.',
'Forget about cockroaches. It’s the subway rats you gotta worry about.',
'Big as beavers.',
'Yeah, some of them go 4 or 5 kilos.',
'Hey, hey. Enough, all right?',
'Listen. You can hear them behind the walls, scratching. There must be thousands of them.',
'Just shut up about the rats.',
'Okay, okay.',
'Hel-lo!',
'Hey!',
'Hello!',
'Winston!',
'Okay, I’m out of here.',
'Aaahhh!',
'They’re gone.',
'What the…?',
'Before we go any further, I think we should get our proton packs.',
'Uh, good idea.',
'What’s that?',
'What’s what?',
'Sounds like a… train.',
'Huh-uh. These lines have been abandoned for fifty years.',
'Oh.',
'Probably in one of the tunnels above us.',
'I don’t know. Sounds awfully close to me.',
'Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh…!!',
'I think that was the old New York Central, City of Albany. Derailed in 1920, killed hundreds of people.',
'Did you catch the number on the locomotive?',
'Sorry. I missed it.',
'Something’s trying to stop us. We must be close.',
'Where’s Ray?',
'Ray…?',
'Ray!',
'Ray…!',
'Ray…',
'Ray?',
'Ray.',
'Guys!',
'Ahh!',
'Oh. Uh, sorry. I found it!',
'What?',
'Right here! There’s a hole!',
'Let’s go.',
'Hey, fellas, what about the packs? What about the packs?',
'Unbelievable.',
'Uh-huh. Did I tell you? I wasn’t lyin’, was I?',
'You know how much negative energy it must have taken to generate a flow this size?',
'Hey. New York. What a town.',
'All right. See how deep it is, get a sounding.',
'Yeah. All right.',
'Six feet… Twelve feet…',
'Twelve?',
'Hey, something’s pulling it.',
'Well, hold on.',
'Well, I’m tryin’ to hold it! Give me a hand here!',
'Ray, help!',
'Give me a hand! Give me a hand!',
'Ray, help! It’s got him! Hold him!',
'Get his belt off!',
'I can’t hold it!',
'Wait, wait, wait! Hold on! Hold! Ahh! Ahh!',
'Ahh ahhh ahhh ahhhhhh…!',
'A toast to… the most charming… kindest…',
'Oh, it’s—it’s me.',
'It’s you.',
'…And most… unusual man… I’ve ever broken up with.',
'Speaking of breaking up with neat guys, why did you dump me?',
'I didn’t dump you. I was… protecting myself.',
'I mean, you weren’t very good for me, you know.',
'You know that, don’t you?',
'Hmm. Well, heck. I’m not even good for me.',
'You’re much better than you realize. You don’t give yourself enough credit.',
'I need to hear that kind of stuff. I mean, if I had this kind of support… on a twenty-four–hour–a–day basis, I could have myself whipped into shape by the end of this century.',
'Well, why don’t you just give me a jingle in the year 2000.',
'Why don’t I give you… a jingle right now?',
'So the seven little dwarves had a limited partnership in a small mining operation…',
'And one day a beautiful princess came to live with them, and they bartered housekeeping services for room and board…',
'Which was a real good deal for them, because they didn’t have to withhold social security or income tax or nothin’…',
'Which you’re really not supposed to do, you see, but for the purposes of this story, I think it’s okay…',
'It really is a great place.',
'I mean, it needs a woman’s touch, but I think it looks really good. You know…',
'Shh. Bedtime.',
'You’re very good with children.',
'Thanks. I practiced on my hamster.',
'Ah… So you live alone?',
'I used to have a roommate, but my mom moved to Florida.',
'Oh… Why don’t you come over here and sit with me.',
'Okay.',
'So you wanna play Boggle or Super Mario Brothers?',
'You know… I think motherhood’s a very natural instinct.',
'I’d like a child myself. Would you?',
'Uh, tonight?',
'Nice goin’, Ray. What are you tryin’ to do, drown me?',
'Oh, yeah, Zeddemore, like it was my fault!',
'You were too stupid not to drop that plumb line!',
'Stupid?! Hey, you better watch your mouth or I’ll punch your lights out!',
'Oh, yeah?!',
'Yeah!',
'Well, anytime!',
'Come on, all right!',
'Come on, right now!',
'It’s go time, man. I want you bad!',
'Wait! Wait! Stop, stop! Get your clothes off! Quick, strip!',
'Oh, dear, Ray! What were we doin’?! I was ready to kill you!',
'It’s this stuff. It’s like pure, concentrated evil.',
'And it’s all flowing… right to this spot.',
'Oh, are you sure this is it?',
'Yeah, he said Armand’s.',
'Uh, excuse me…',
'Now, it’s all right. We’ll be right back.',
'Venkman!',
'No no no no…!',
'Hey, hey, Venkman!',
'Oh, ho ho ho ho…!',
'Please leave! You cannot…!',
'It was absolutely incredible! The greatest tangible evidence of psychic energy in a hundred years.',
'You’re disturbing our guests!',
'This is an emergency! Just a second!',
'Boys! Boys! You’re scaring the straights, okay?! Is there any way we can do this tomorrow?!',
'No, no, this won’t wait until tomorrow, Venkman! It’s hot, and it’s ready to pop!',
'Yeah. It’s—it’s—it’s all over the city, Pete! Under it, actually.',
'Rivers of this stuff!',
'Yes, and it’s all flowing right to the museum!',
'Yeah, the museum!!',
'Ah…! Oh…!',
'Look what he got all over me! What is this stuff?',
'Sorry.',
'Oh, God. You mean… my museum?',
'I was… I was gonna tell you between the dessert and the cheese course.',
'There they are!',
'You can never go back there. You’re gonna have to find a new job…',
'Psychomagnotheric plasma…',
'It affects behavior! We were fighting!',
'We were in a fight!',
'He had him by the throat!',
'I’m glad they’re here! We gotta see the mayor!',
'Oh… Ghostbusters!',
'How you doing?',
'Hey, guys, come right this way!',
'Hey, you guys got another one of those proton packs? My kid brother really wants one.',
'The proton pack is not a toy.',
'I guess he’s right.',
'Oh-ah…!',
'Oh, oh, Dana, we were just babysitting, honest. And—and we watched some TV, and had something to eat, and then one thing led to another…',
'That’s all right. I know what you were doing.',
'I mean, I didn’t know anything was going to happen, really.',
'Hi, Dana. How was your date?',
'It wasn’t a date, it was just dinner.',
'Well, where’s Peter?',
'Well, he was arrested.',
'Typical.',
'Did he call?',
'No, no, no. Nobody called.',
'Hmm. Well, how’s Oscar? Is he all right?',
'Oh… Oh, he’s fine. Such a good baby.',
'He was a little fussy at first, then we just gave him some French-bread pizza… passed right out.',
'Good. Good, well, I’ll just give him a look-see.',
'Whew…',
'So you think we should go?',
'Oh, gee, I don’t know. I don’t think we should leave her alone.',
'You’re right, let’s stay.',
'Lenny! Hey! Big man!',
'Ghostbusters.',
'Mr. Mayor.',
'What is this… a slumber party?',
'Well, that’s what we’re here to talk to you about, sir, see we…',
'Look, I don’t wanna hear anything about it.',
'You’ve got two minutes. Make it good.',
'Ah, well, uh, first of all, Mr. Mayor, it’s a great pleasure to see you again.',
'And we’d like to say that almost 50% of us voted for you in the last election.',
'I appreciate that.',
'I’m just sorry we always meet under these circumstances.',
'Mr. Mayor. We’re here tonight because a psychomagnotheric slime flow of immense proportions is building up beneath the city.',
'Psycho-what?',
'Psychomagnotheric.',
'Big word. Big word.',
'Negative human emotions are materializing in the form of a viscous, psychoreactive plasm with explosive supernormal potential.',
'Does anybody speak English here?',
'Uh, yeah, yea—Your Honor. See, what we’re trying to tell you is, like, all the bad feelings—I mean, all the hate, the anger, and violence of this city is turning into this sludge.',
'Now, I didn’t believe it at first either. But we just went for a swim in it, and we ended up almost killing each other!',
'This is insane! I mean, do we really have to listen to this?!',
'Can’t you stop your lips from flapping for two little minutes?!',
'Lenny. Have you been out on the street lately? Do you know how weird it is out there?',
'We’ve taken our own head count! There seem to be three million completely miserable assholes living in the tri-state area!',
'Oh, please…',
'I beg your pardon. Three million and one.',
'Hey.',
'And what budgie-brain here doesn’t realize, is that if we don’t do something fast, this whole place is gonna blow like a frog on a hot plate.',
'Yeah, right.',
'What am I supposed to do? Go on television and tell ten million people they have to be nice to each other?',
'Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker’s God-given right.',
'Your two minutes are up. Good night, gentlemen.',
'Wait!',
'You’re making a mistake, Mr. Mayor! A very newsworthy mistake! No, “The Times” is gonna be interested in this, and you know “The Post”…',
'Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, now, now…!',
'“Mayor Drowns in River of Slime”?',
'“Mayor Hides Slime”?',
'“Times Square Slime”?',
'“Slime Square”!',
'Fine, fine. Now, before you go running off to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime business to some of our people downtown?',
'It’s gotta be done right away.',
'Well, it’s gonna come back! This city’s in danger! The whole state! The world! All we wanna do is help!',
'I’m warning you!',
'Uh, the mayor wants them kept under strict observation for the next few days.',
'Uh, we think they’re seriously disturbed and potentially dangerous.',
'Well, we’ll do whatever’s necessary.',
'Thank you, doctor.',
'I await the word of Vigo.',
'I, Vigo, the Scourge of Carpathia—',
'I know, you’ve told me this, the scourge…',
'—the Sorrow of Moldavia—',
'Sorrows, I’ve heard all of this, yes…',
'—command you!',
'Command me, lord.',
'The Season of Evil begins with the birth of the new year.',
'Good!',
'Bring me the child, that I might live again.',
'Yes!',
'Lord Vigo… I was wondering… eh…',
'This woman, Dana, is fine and strong.',
'Now… if… I… was to, eh… bring the baby, could I have that woman?',
'So be it.',
'On this day of darkness, she will be ours. Wife to you and mother to me.',
'Yes!! Thank you, lord! Thank you!',
'I mean, is like, she the killer or what?',
'No, that’s Rita Hayworth. And she was married to Citizen Kane while they were doin’ this thing.',
'And right after they finished, she dumped him for some polo player. (Thanks.)',
'I don’t know why beautiful women love horses so much. Do you love horses?',
'No.',
'You know, you really don’t have to stay. I’m sure Peter will be back soon.',
'Oh, we don’t mind.',
'Can you see okay?',
'Yep.',
'Oscar?',
'Uh…! Oh, God! Oscar!',
'Louis!',
'What?',
'It’s Oscar!',
'Oscar…',
'Call 911 right now!',
'Oscar! Oh, no…',
'No, no, no!',
'No!',
'Oh, God! That was a ghost!',
'No. No, that was Janosz.',
'What?! Why?!',
'He took him.',
'What?! What’s happening?!',
'Well, what should we do?!',
'Where’s the baby?!',
'The museum!',
'Well, where are you going?!',
'I’ve got to get my baby!',
'We gotta find the guys.',
'As I explained before: We think the spirit of a 17th-century Moldavian tyrant is alive and well in a painting at the Manhattan Museum of Art.',
'Uh-huh, and are there any other paintings in the museum with bad spirits in them?',
'You’re wasting valuable time. He’s drawing strength from a psychomagnotheric slime flow that’s been collecting under the city.',
'Yes, tell me about the slime.',
'It’s very potent stuff.',
'We made a toaster dance with it.',
'A toaster?',
'And a bathtub tried to eat his friend’s baby.',
'A bathtub?',
'Don’t look at me. I think these people are completely nuts.',
'Oscar.',
'Sweetheart.',
'Sweetie. Oh, sweetie.',
'I thought I’d lost you, that I’d never see you again.',
'Oh, baby. Oh, my baby.',
'Hello, Dana. I thought that you might come.',
'You stay away from us, Janosz. I mean it.',
'Oh, don’t worry. He will not be harmed.',
'Eh—He—He has been chosen… to be the vessel… of the spirit of Vigo.',
'And you… will be the mother of the ruler of the world.',
'Doesn’t that sound nice?',
'No. It sounds ludicrous.',
'You stay away from him. I mean it.',
'Well, I don’t think we have choice here, yes?',
'Take a look. It’s not Gainsborough’s “Blue Boy” there, hah? Eh, heh heh. He is Vigo!',
'I don’t care who he is. You’re not gonna take my baby!',
'No! Oscar! Oh, you bastard!',
'This a big dinosaur or a little dinosaur?',
'Oh, just a skeleton, huh? Well, which way was it heading?',
'Wait a sec. What was chasing you in the park? The park bench was chasing you? I see…',
'What? Wait a second.',
'Lieutenant, I think you better talk to this guy.',
'I’m busy here.',
'It’s some dock supervisor down at Pier 34.',
'What’s the problem?',
'He says the Titanic just arrived.',
'Well… Better late than never.',
'Battery is swamped. We’ve had more than three thousand calls since midnight last night!',
'We’ve got every man in uniform on the streets. And I am still shorthanded!',
'We’ve got meter maids chasing ghosts all over midtown.',
'There’s this shell thing over the Manhattan Museum of Art. We can’t make a dent!',
'Have you tried dynamite?',
'We’ve tried everything.',
'What the hell’s goin’ on? It’s pandemonium out there!',
'Yes, I—I—I know. We’re working on it.',
'Great. While you’re working on it, I’m going down in history as the mayor who let New York get sucked down into the tenth level of hell.',
'All right. We’ve got no choice. Call the Ghostbusters.',
'Wait! Uh… Now, I—I’m sure there’s another way.',
'Jack. I spent an hour last night in my bedroom talking to Fiorello La Guardia, and he’s been dead for forty years.',
'Now, where are the Ghostbusters?',
'They’re not available.',
'What do you mean, they’re not available?',
'Well, I had them committed to the psychiatric ward at Parkview Hospital.',
'You what?',
'They were threatening to go to the press! I was protecting your interests!',
'Oh, yeah?',
'Uh-huh…!',
'Well, you can stop protecting my interests. You have exactly three minutes to clear out! You’re fired!!',
'But… the election…!',
'Harry. Remove this man from the building.',
'You’re making a mistake, Mr. Mayor…! Harry…!',
'And get me the Ghostbusters!!',
'Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor! Come take a look at this.',
'Wow…',
'Whoa…',
'What is that…?',
'Have you ever seen anything like that…?',
'Somebody get me the Ghostbusters.',
'…And then he took the baby, and he put it in a, uh, a carriage, and then levitated away!',
'What did Dana do, where’d she go?',
'I don’t know, she was going to the museum to get the baby back!',
'And then there was an eclipse, and the whole town went dark, and everybody’s nuts!',
'It all fits. Vigo wants in on the 21st century. He needs a human body to inhabit. Little Oscar must be it.',
'And I bet we’re the only ones who can help, right?',
'You bet we are!',
'Looks like a giant… Jell-O mold.',
'I hate Jell-O.',
'Oh, come on. There’s always room for Jell-O.',
'Soon it will be midnight, and the city will be mine and Vigo’s.',
'Well, mainly Vigo’s.',
'Oo, Dana. You and I have this terrific opportunity to make the best of this relationship.',
'We don’t have a relationship.',
'I know!',
'Marry me, Dana. Together we will raise Vigo as our son.',
'And let me tell you something here. There are many perks in being the mother of a living god.',
'I’m sure we could get a magnificent, eh, apartment, car, free parking…',
'Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance.',
'Yet I think that perhaps you and I could learn to… love each other?',
'Yes. I could learn.',
'Pull ‘em.',
'Full neutronas.',
'Let’s cook!',
'Save ‘em.',
'That slime wall is pulsing with evil.',
'It would take a tremendous amount of positive energy to crack that shell, and I seriously doubt that there’s enough goodwill left in this town to do it.',
'You know, I just can’t believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there’s no way back.',
'I mean, sure, it’s dirty, it’s crowded, it’s polluted, it’s noisy, and there’s people all around who’d just as soon… step on your face as look at you.',
'But come on! There gotta be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.',
'We just have to figure out a way to mobilize it!',
'He’s right. We need something that everyone in this town can get behind. We need…',
'A symbol.',
'Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us.',
'Something good.',
'Something decent.',
'Something pure.',
'Kind of makes you wonder, doesn’t it?',
'Wonder what?',
'Whether she’s naked under that toga.',
'She’s French. You know that.',
'Got it.',
'Ready with the speakers, Ray. Slime blowers ready?',
'Okay. Internal audio is set. Internal electric set.',
'Slime blower primed and set.',
'Ooh, good slime, good slime.',
'Winston, is our slime in a good mood tonight?',
'I hope so. She’s a lot bigger than a toaster.',
'All yours, Venkman. Let’s go.',
'Thank you.',
'Testing, one, two, testing!',
'Hey, how many of you people here tonight are a national monument? Would you raise your hand, please?',
'Oh, hello, miss…',
'Hey. Let’s frost it.',
'It’s slime time.',
'Beautiful.',
'Pilot controls are ready.',
'All right. It’s getting late. It’s almost midnight. Let’s go, Venkman.',
'Here’s something off the request line from Liberty Island!',
'We gonna squeeze some New Year’s juice from ya, Big Apple.',

'Uh, sorry! My fault!',
'Happy New Year.',
'Stay fit. Keep sharp. Make good decisions.',
'Oh… Good, oh, good, oh, good.',
'Oh, it’s you.',
'Okay. But I didn’t know you had your license.',

'It’s happening. It’s really happening.',
'N—! Wha—No! No!',
'No! Go away from here!',
'I love you when you roughhouse!',
'Hit it, Mama!',
'Drop the hammer on her!',
'Go! Do it now!',
'Oscar, look!',
'Go away!',
'You don’t know who that is?!',
'Happy New Year.',
'He’s Vigo!',
'You are like the buzzing of flies to him!',
'Oh, Johnny, did you back the wrong horse.',
'Will you hose him, please?',
'Hose him.',
'Aiigh!',
'One down.',
'On the ground.',
'Boy, am I… glad to see you.',
'Oh, Oscar. Oscar.',
'Is he dead?',
'Huh-uh. This slime is positively charged. He’ll wake up feeling like a million bucks.',
'Whoa, this gentleman is a little bit ripe.',
'That’s all right, my friend. I think I had an accident too.',
'Wha-ahh! Aah!',
'Get him away!',
'Get a knife or something! We gotta cut her out of this!',
'Okay. All right. Now, listen. You gotta stay right here. Don’t move.',
'Uncle Pete’s gotta go help your mom for a second. You stay right here and don’t say anything, okay?',
'Uh-oh.',
'Hold it right there, deadhead!',
'You want a baby? Go ahead and knock up some willing hellhound!',
'Otherwise, I’m giving you three to get back in that painting where you belong!',
'One!',
'Two.',
'Three!',
'You got him! You got him!',
'Ah… Oh…',
'That was really stupid.',
'Ray? Can you move?',
'No. Are you okay?',
'No. Venkman? How are you?',
'I’m fine.',
'No. No! Oscar.',
'Please, do something!',
'Not so fast, Vigo!',
'Hey! Vigo!',
'Yeah, you. The bimbo with the baby.',
'Didn’t anybody tell you the big-shoulder look is out?',
'You know, I have met some dumb blonds in my life—but you take the taco, pal.',
'Only a Carpathian would come back to life now and choose New York!',
'Tasty pick, bonehead!',
'If you had brain-one in that huge melon on top of your neck, you would be living the sweet life out in Southern California’s beautiful San Fernando Valley!',
'Aargh!',

'Oh, sweetie! It’s okay…',

'Yeah.',

'Hey.',
'Ah… Ah… Ah…',
'Sir. Are you all right?',
'Why am I drippings with goo?',
'You had a violent, prolonged, transformative psychic episode.',
'Heh?',
'Sorry we had to hose you there, but you were kind of out of control.',
'Hey. Man. Let me tell you somethin’. I love you.',
'Yes?',
'Yeah.',
'Well, I love you too! Ah, heh heh…',
'Wow.',

'Uh-huh, got it.',
'You’re better at other things. Like… quesadillas.',

'Thank you.',
'Now what?',
'Mom!',
'Really? You don’t have legs?',
'I’m not an adult.',
'I’m literally driving to pick up a check right now.',
'You… win lottery?',
'Kind of. My father died.',
'Relax. I didn’t even know him. I’m surprised he left me anything.',
'Sounds like my father.',
'Yeah? Did your dad, uh, abandon your family and move to a farm in the middle of nowhere?',
'No.',
'Look, I… I know I have not been a reliable or consistent tenant.',
'But—if you can just give me a week to settle some loose ends, I will be back with everything I owe.',
'I can fix that!',
'Listen. I wait for you to leave, then I change locks.',
'There it is. This is Summerville. This is where your grandfather lived.',

'Probably just fracking.',
'Well, it’s fracking annoying, is what it is.',
'It’s okay, at least we’re only here for a week.',
'Um… give or take.',
'What does that mean?',
'It means we’re staying.',
'You said we’re only gonna be here for a week!',
'Yeah, well, that was before we got evicted.',
'You said you had money saved up.',
'Yeah, well, that was before I had children.',
'Oh!',
'To be fair, you’ve never been good with money.',

'Hi.',
'Hi…',
'I’m, uh, Janine Melnitz. We spoke on the phone.',
'Uh, I was your father’s, uh… We were… friends, uh…',
'Very sorry for your loss.',
'It’s okay. You knew him better than me. I should be sorry for your loss.',
'Well, I just tried to keep the bills… paid on time, that kind of thing.',
'Like a money manager?',
'Oh, there was no money to manage. He could barely keep the power on.',
'So he left us nothing?',
'Well… I wouldn’t say that.',
'There is quite a bit of debt.',
'Miss Melnitz. I’m here to sign forms, pack the silverware, and leave with the rent check.',

'You mean, aside from the sentimental value?',
'Are you going to that thing later?',
'Yeah, probably.',
'Hey! Where’s my order?',
'I can’t believe a place like this still exists.',
'I can’t believe we have to spend a summer in this heap.',

'No. You’re a mom. You live for us.',
'I’ll be right back.',
'Oh.',
'Hey. Maybe you will make a friend out here.',
'Make them out of what?',
'I’m serious.',

'I can tell them you have a pulse.',
'My name’s Trevor.',
'“My name’s Trevor.”',

'Yeah.',
'You have a chance with her. You really do.',
'So where you headin’?',
'We’re staying, actually.',
'You know that farmhouse off the highway with the barn? Dirt? It was my father’s.',

'No, it’s not.',
'Okay, you can drop me off here.',

'Love you!',

'She sits alone.',
'An outcast, rejected by her peers.',

'Perhaps she’s on the run.',
'On the run… from herself.',
'And… go!',
'Actually, my grandfather died.',
'My mom says we’re just here to pick through the rubble of his life.',
'So you’re here to uncover the mystery of his death?',
'No. It was natural causes.',
'Are you sure it wasn’t… unnatural causes?',
'Yes. Pretty sure it was just a heart attack.',
'Oh, the silent killer.',
'I’m Phoebe.',
'Oh, cool. Uh, I’m Podcast.',
'Why do people call you Podcast?',
'Oh. I call myself Podcast. Because of my podcast.',
'Doin’ some paintin’?',
'Uh, yeah…',
'Whereabouts you stayin’?',
'Um… That old apocalyptic ranch off of 99. It was my father’s place.',
'Dirt Farmer had a family?',
'You all called him the Dirt Farmer?',
'Meant nothin’ by it.',
'Man spends every week workin’ a piece of land… but never seedin’, never waterin’, never growin’ a ding-dang thing. It’s curious behavior.',
'Great customer though.',
'He… He bought some bizarre shit.',
'Yeah, that sounds like him.',
'What is this?',
'Hello.',
'Um… You know, there’s a highly entertaining movie about a killer dog happening right over there.',
'Is this a seismic map?',
'Yes. Um. How did you know that?',
'Because it’s a map of seismic activity.',
'Right. But—',
'You’re a seismologist?',
'Does… that… seem so hard to believe?',
'Figured you for a football coach.',
'Oh. Um… Thank you.',
'These don’t look tectonic or volcanic.',
'Uh… Uh, okay, smarty.',
'Here, check this out.',
'This is a volcano, all right?',
'It… builds… and crests.',
'But this is a tectonic earthquake—notice little P-wave, followed by a large S-wave.',
'Yeh—Yeah, I’m not an idiot.',
'Clearly. Well. This is the pattern in Summerville: Large P-wave, small S-wave. Like an explosion.',
'Where is it coming from?',
'I don’t know. I don’t know. I—I set up geophones, but I can’t triangulate.',
'Are you using three?',
'Yeah.',
'I know how many sides there are in a triangle.',
'I just thought you were being obtuse.',
'Was that a geometry joke?',
'Yes, that’s why I winked.',
'Ah. Uh. That’s terrible.',
'No, I loved it.',
'Yes, I mean. Somehow… a town that isn’t anywhere near a tectonic plate, that has no underground volcanic activity, no fault lines, no fracking, no loud music even, is shaking on a daily basis.',
'Maybe it’s the apocalypse.',
'Twenty-three… twenty-four… twenty-five…',
'Hey, no-skills. How’s inventory?',
'Oh, hey. How’s it going? No, it’s not good. It’s not good at all.',
'Um… Does everyone do this?',
'Yeah, it’s super important.',
'You okay?',
'Your lips are… literally blue.',
'Yeah, I’m… fine.',
'You should borrow my hoodie.',
'No, it’s fine. Seriously, it’s fine.',
'It’s really masculine.',
'It’s got a wolf on it. Trust me.',
'Okay…',
'I’m actually kind of surprised it fits me.',
'Yeah, it’s my boyfriend’s, actually.',
'Oh…',
'Back to inventory.',
'Okay, we’re speeding. Three… two… one…',
'Uh, yeah. Just introduce yourself and tell me what you ate for breakfast.',
'Um, Phoebe. Toast.',
'Okay. Um. Maybe a little more. Tell me a joke or something.',
'A joke?',
'Mmm-hmm.',
'What do you call a dead polar bear?',
'Anything you want. It can’t hear you now.',
'Wow. That was funny. You’re funny.',
'Pretty hilarious joke.',
'Fun fact: Did you know that Summerville actually has more dead residents than living ones?',
'Yeah, that’s—that’s how cemeteries work.',
'Wertheimers Hardware. Run by the Illuminati. (Lizard people.)',
'Lizard people?',
'Jefferson, Einstein, Beyoncé? How do you think we got the pyramids?',
'Slaves?',
'Movie theater. Oh, yeah. That one’s haunted.',
'I don’t believe in ghosts.',
'What? How can you—? I mean—all the evidence! You don’t believe in spirits?',
'No. I think we’re all just… kind of meat puppets.',
'There’s something you need to see. I’ll grab my wheels.',
'Are we even allowed to be here?',
'Oh, yeah. Totally.',
'The mine’s been closed since the ‘40s.',
'They just put all these signs up ‘cause of… hazardous chemical leaks… and on account of dynamite.',
'I do this.',
'The whole town was basically a mining operation.',
'They bore out this mountain like a grapefruit and smelted everything into cold-riveted selenium girders.',
'Why would you make a steel beam out of an electro-conductor like selenium?',
'Right? Weird.',
'Until one day, they were forced to close down the whole enchilada.',
'Why?',
'One by one, miners who had worked for years began leaping down the mine shaft… to their death.',
'They called it… the Shandorian curse.',
'Who built these?',
'Depends who you believe.',
'One day, they just showed up without explanation.',
'Cool.',
'What a shitbox.',
'So what’s your podcast about?',
'Oh, um… mostly mysteries and the unknown, uh… conspiracy theories, the occasional restaurant review.',
'Well, maybe I could check it out sometime.',
'Really?',
'Yeah.',
'The show really finds its voice on Episode 46.',
'Okay.',
'Uh… hey… uh—look, this is totally cool if this is a no, uh, zero “presh”… uh… but, um…',
'Do you wanna be my lab partner?',
'Well, I don’t think we’re gonna be doing any labs, but…',
'Yeah. Yeah, sure, I’d love to.',
'Cool, cool. All right.',
'Yeah…',
'Well, this is me.',
'The Dirt Farmer’s house?',
'Yeah, he was my grandfather.',
'No way, dude!',
'So you’re just gonna walk in?',
'Are you recording me?',
'Yeah, just in case your body’s pulled apart into tiny pieces by an unseen dark force.',
'All right. Bye.',
'Okay, so this is happening.',
'Hello?',
'Uh! Ah! No! Aiigh!!',
'Hi, I’m Chucky. Wanna play?',
'I need to know what’s lurking inside.',
'No way. Killer replica.',
'Totally. A replica of what?',
'Trap.',
'A ghost trap?',
'Seriously? How do you of all people not know about this?',
'I’m ashamed.',
'Oh… I was obsessed.',
'New York in the ‘80s? It was like “The Walking Dead”.',
'Then it just stopped?',
'Mmm-hmm. I mean, there hasn’t been a ghost sighting in thirty years.',
'Wait a minute.',
'This thing is real?',
'Absolutely.',
'Maybe.',
'I found it in my living room.',
'She lives on the Dirt Farm.',
'Oh, the really spooky one?',
'Yeah, the one that says “Dirt” on it.',
'What happened in New York?',
'The whole city was freaking out.',
'And then these physicists showed up with these portable proton accelerators and blew the roof off a Manhattan high-rise.',
'None of this rings a bell?',
'It happened twenty years before we were born.',
'I believe it.',
'Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!',
'I mean… your, uh… dad never m—mentioned this?',
'It’s just my mom.',
'Just your mom. Oh… um… Cool.',
'“Cool”?',
'I wonder if this still works.',
'Should we open it?',
'Glasses.',
'Two millimeters of plastic eye protection?',
'Are you sure this is safe?',
'Safe? Heh. No. No…',
'History is safe. Geometry, that’s safe.',
'Science is… all particle accelerators and hydrogen bombs.',
'Science is giving yourself the plague and gambling on the cure.',
'Science is reckless.',
'Totally! Yes! It’s punk rock.',
'It’s a safety pin through the nipple of academia.',
'Ouch.',
'Fire it up.',
'I’ve always wanted to do this.',
'Aaahhhh!!',
'Yes!!',
'Uh… We should probably get out of here.',
'You’re an adult.',
'Yeah. And liable.',
'You know what this means, right?',
'Your grandfather was a Ghostbuster.',
'Yes, I’m aware.',
'It has a door and windows, like any ordinary house.',
'But the distinct smell of evil… is prominent.',
'What are you doing?',
'Oh, um… Giving a little color. Setting the mood.',
'It’s creepy. I dig it.',
'Wow.',
'Cool.',
'Whoa! Aztec death whistle.',
'That’s designed to ward off evil spirits.',
'It’s actually got a really horrifying sound—',
'What—?',
'Um… What the hell is that?',
'Aztec death whistle. Uh, can I keep it?',
'Yes, please, just don’t do that again.',
'Hi.',
'Hello again.',
'You… brought them home.',
'It’s a service I provide.',
'Are…?',
'Well, I’m—I’m also an escort.',
'Mmm…?',
'That came out wrong.',
'Kind of. Yep.',
'Look, the truth is, I’ve always kind of wondered what lurked inside this… haunt box.',
'Right. Well, the only thing lurking inside here is my slowly dying soul.',
'Is that what that smell is?',
'Well, it’s not dinner, so…',
'Well, all right then…',
'Um… Would you…?',
'Sure.',
'Like?',
'Yeah.',
'I don’t have any food.',
'It’s fine.',
'Tour.',
'Great!',
'Great.',
'Here’s the dining room…',
'I think Grooberson’s trying to bone your mom.',
'Oh.',
'That doesn’t bother you?',
'No, of course it bothers me.',
'I just don’t exhibit emotions the same way everyone else does.',
'Inside, I’m vomiting.',
'Wait.',
'Isn’t this what we saw earlier?',
'“The Sumerians believed in a land of the dead, a dark and shadowy realm within the bowels of the earth.',
'“The souls of the dead are ruled by a mighty god, Gozer, and protected by a powerful Gatekeeper and Keymaster, in order that Gozer might rise up and walk the human plane again.',
'“The Gatekeeper and Keymaster must assume the form of beasts.”',
'What did we let out?',
'Yum.',
'Has this ever been cleaned before?',
'Not by me.',
'We’re heading up the mountain.',
'You coming?',
'Rivers are like the moms of canyons.',
'Basically, when you think about it.',
'Why’d you bring me up here?',
'Entertainment value.',
'Can you juggle?',
'What are you doing here in Summerville anyway?',
'Honestly, my mom won’t say it, but we’re broke.',
'And we just got evicted, and the only thing that’s left in our name is this creepy, old farmhouse our grandfather left us in the middle of nowhere.',
'No offense.',
'Not offended.',
'This place is a dump.',
'Then why do you live here?',
'I’m fourth-generation dump, so…',
'Oh.',
'You think you’ll ever leave?',
'I mean, if I don’t… what does that say about me?',
'You don’t have a car.',
'The hell…?',
'Get out!',
'What is that?',
'I don’t know.',
'Gozer!!',
'Ha ha ha…!',
'It’s not funny.',
'What is this?',
'Um, that’s a map.',
'Yeah, I know it’s a… a map. But this… this thing’s ancient.',
'It’s written in some kind of cuneiform.',
'Oh, yeah?',
'This is Summerville.',
'Well, that doesn’t make sense.',
'No, not at all.',
'I mean—Summerville’s not even a hundred years old, but this thing’s written in a language from thousands of years ago.',
'Well, for all I know, that’s the language he spoke.',
'That’s it—?',
'You don’t think this is incredible and bizarre and fascinating?!',
'Can I have this?',
'Yeah, sure. Weirdo.',
'That’s how it starts, you know.',
'First there’s a map, then you move into a haunted house, then everyone’s calling you the Dirt Farmer.',
'What about Phoebe? You think she’d want any of this?',
'Oh, I’m sure Phoebe will find something.',
'Hello?',
'Two of the CRT emitters are missing.',
'Thanks.',
'How on earth did you build such a small cyclotron?',
'Got it. You’re a genius.',
'Needle-nose pliers?',
'Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?',
'Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?',
'Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter, or ghost?',
'If the answer is yes, then don’t wait another minute.',
'Pick up your phone and call the professionals.',
'Ghostbusters.',
'Our courteous and efficient staff is on call twenty-four hours a day to serve all your supernatural-elimination needs.',
'We’re ready to believe you.',
'Hey… You’re awake.',
'What are you up to?',
'Experiments.',
'Ugh, lame.',
'Oh… You found popcorn.',
'What kind of scientist was Grandpa?',
'The kind that repels loved ones.',
'Maybe a physicist?',
'Sure.',
'So tomorrow I was thinking of grabbing dinner with Gary.',
'Who’s Gary?',
'Mr. Grooberson.',
'His name is Gary Grooberson?',
'You have a date with Gary Grooberson.',
'It’s just dinner.',
'Good night, Phoebe.',
'Don’t be yourself…!',
'Welcome to Rust City.',
'This is where they processed all the raw selenium?',
'Yeah, I guess.',
'Cool…',
'How’d you know how to fix it?',
'I mean, no offense, but you are twelve.',
'I kind of met my grandfather last night.',
'He showed me what to do.',
'No way. Was he, like, howling and clanking chains?',
'No. That would’ve been weird.',
'Switch me on.',
'Safety’s off.',
'Her feet are planted. Her face is poised.',
'Will this be the moment of her death?',
'Nobody knows.',
'Yeah!! Ha ha ha ha! Whoo…!!',
'Oh, my gosh.',
'That is the best thing I’ve ever seen.',
'Did I hit it?',
'You didn’t hit it! You destroyed it! It doesn’t even exist anymore!',
'My turn.',
'What was that?',
'Probably a pigeon or something. Give me the gun.',
'What is that?',
'Come on.',
'Hold on.',
'You coming?',
'I’m comin’.',
'Oh!',
'I gotta come back here for my Halloween episode.',
'(It’s a ghost.)',
'(Aren’t you just a little bit freaked out right now?)',
'(Overstimulation calms me.)',
'(Okay, okay, okay, okay…)',
'What’s that for?',
'I have a plan.',
'Wait!',
'Get the trap!',
'Yeah! Okay!',
'I got him!',
'Quick!',
'Nuggets! Aah!',
'Catch him!',
'Okay.',
'Ugh, come on!',
'Come on, you can do this.',
'Come on, darling.',
'Yes!',
'Yes!!',
'Shit!',
'Hey.',
'Hey… This is Podcast.',
'He—He’s my friend.',
'You have a friend?',
'You have a car?',
'It’s a Cadillac.',
'Hey, dude. We need a ride. Do you know how to drive?',
'He doesn’t. He failed his driver’s test three times.',
'Get in the back.',
'Thank you.',
'It sounds crazy, but Oklahoma never had earthquakes, for centuries.',
'But then, between 2010 and 2016, they had like a thousand.',
'Oh, jeez, what happened?',
'Oil and gas, that’s what happened.',
'Yeah, they started pumping millions of gallons of salinated water deep into the Arbuckle Formation.',
'And then the porous limestone…',
'Are you drunk? Or are you just really bored?',
'No…',
'Because I think I can see you falling asleep.',
'Uh… I just have, uh… an allergy to science.',
'Ah. Have you tried Benadryl?',
'I’ve tried, um, whiskey.',
'It’s better than Benadryl.',
'But science is amazing. Science is—is—is… pure. It’s an absolute.',
'I mean, it’s an answer to all the madness.',
'Why don’t you like science?',
'Was, uh… Was Phoebe’s dad a scientist, or…?',
'Oh, gross. No.',
'No?',
'I’m making an assumption. What’s his deal?',
'Honestly, I don’t… doesn’t matter.',
'He just—He was… fine with Trevor, but with Phoebe, he just really… He couldn’t connect with her, so…',
'Right. Well, he sounds like a royal dirtbag.',
'Oh, no, he was actually just a very ordinary dirtbag.',
'Well, hey, at least, uh… Phoebe turned out okay, right?',
'I hope so. I don’t know.',
'She just—She really keeps me on the outside.',
'She’s just an awkward, nerdy kid, but she’s awesome.',
'I think she’s great.',
'I think you’re great. You’re a great mom.',
'Yeah. You showed up. You win.',
'I just wish she’d relax, you know? Just get into some trouble.',
'Hey, there’s plenty of time for that.',
'Who knows, maybe she’ll take up pole dancing.',
'Well, she’s not very coordinated.',
'Oh, I don’t think that matters.',
'So what the hell is going on?',
'In the 1980s, New York City was attacked.',
'Yeah, no. I know the Manhattan ghost stories.',
'Yeah, well, the stories are real.',
'Yeah. And so were the guys who climbed a building and saved the world. And fought back an invading army of the undead.',
'Not to mention a one-hundred-foot marshmallow man.',
'Our grandfather was Egon Spengler. He was a Ghostbuster.',
'All units, we’re getting reports of… Well. Some kind of animal taking a bite out of Steve Fletcher’s truck.',
'Apparently, he almost took the whole tailgate off?',
'Muncher!',
'Muncher.',
'So what should I be looking for?',
'Evidence.',
'Can you stop breathing in my ear?',
'No.',
'You guys, this is kind of stupid. Are you sure you didn’t see, like… a raccoon or, like… a possum?',
'There!',
'Is that a…?',
'Free-floating metal muncher. Definitely class five.',
'Okay, uh… What do we do?',
'(Let’s get him.)',
'What?!',
'I’m gonna get a photo first.',
'Guys?',
'Whoa, whoa, whoa!',
'Whoa. It has a gunner seat?',
'Go, go, go!',
'Whoa-oh!',
'Aaah!!',
'What the…?!',
'Yes!',
'Trap him!',
'Okay. Okay… Here we go…',
'Come on, keep it straight!',
'You try driving this thing.',
'Left! Left! Left!',
'Ready!',
'Trap him already!',
'Three…!',
'Three…',
'Two…!',
'One.',
'Aaaahhhh!',
'Oh, my God, what just happened?!',
'He’s heading for the mountain!',
'Closer.',
'Okay.',
'I’m in range.',
'She got him!',
'Whatever we’re doing, we have to do it now.',
'Come on!',
'Whoo!!',
'Yeah!!',
'Yes!!',
'Bridge!!!',
'Aaaahhhhh!!!',
'What was that?!',
'I think we just caught a ghost.',
'Ah!',
'Sorry.',
'I was here last night.',
'Does any of this bother you?',
'What do you mean?',
'Dude. Your grandfather was a legend. You can literally be anything you want.',
'Like a… influencer… or a DJ.',
'I guess I just thought it was easier when I thought he went nuts.',
'He didn’t go nuts.',
'Exactly. So why did he leave Mom?',
'Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no…',
'We’re screwed. We’re so screwed.',
'What do we do?',
'I say we fight.',
'What? No. Just check the glove box.',
'License and registration.',
'We were on that big mountain. And then I went to go hang out with this girl in this old, rusty mining cage.',
'And all of a sudden, it just started shaking, like an earthquake.',
'And there were lights, and—then I looked down into this giant hole.',
'And—inside of it, like right in the middle of it, was either… a person or… a reptile—Are you even paying attention right now?',
'Yeah. I’m just—excited we’re in jail.',
'I thought I heard… something say… “Gozer”.',
'He speaks the truth. I was there.',
'Hey! H—Hi—How… What brings you here?',
'Actually, you could… really help me with hiding something.',
'Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh…',
'Do you have priors?',
'No.',
'They’ll charge you as a minor. You’ll get two years. Max.',
'Uh… Two?',
'I’ll visit you, okay?',
'Lucky.',
'Quit messing with my inmates.',
'Sorry, Dad.',
'“Dad.” So you’re just…',
'Waiting for my ride, yeah.',
'But… You look good… behind bars.',
'Hey. Don’t we get a phone call?',
'Sure you do.',
'Who you gonna call?',
'Make it quick.',
'Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?',
'Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter, or ghost?',
'If the answer is yes, then don’t wait another minute.',
'Pick up your phone and call the professionals.',
'Ray’s Occult, and we’re closed—',
'Wait! I only get one phone call.',
'I’m… in prison.',
'Hmm. The slammer, huh? I’ve been there myself.',
'I’m not a lawyer, but I’m listening.',
'Are you Ray Stantz, the Ghostbuster?',
'And now I’m hanging up—',
'Hang on, please!',
'I… I’m calling about Egon Spengler.',
'Egon Spengler can rot in hell.',
'He died last week.',
'Oh, man. No kidding.',
'Weren’t you two friends?',
'That was a long time ago.',
'What happened to you guys?',
'Oh, well, look—When we started, busting ghosts was a gas.',
'Economy was good. Reagan years. People believed in us.',
'Then things got slow. Hauntings got thin.',
'Venkman thought we did our job too well.',
'Oh, we could barely keep up our mortgage.',
'Some actor bought up most of TriBeCa, and we lost the firehouse. It’s a Starbucks now.',
'So then you all just walked away?',
'Peter went back to academia.',
'He’s at SUNY Cortland now. He’s a professor emeritus. He teaches advertising and promotion.',
'Winston went into finance.',
'He worked hard, coined a fortune.',
'And… And I’m here.',
'Well, what about Egon?',
'Well, he wasn’t helping.',
'We went from ten calls a week to one if we were lucky.',
'Then Egon started to tell people that their little ghost problems didn’t matter because “the world was coming to an end”.',
'He got spooky. Freaked me out!',
'One morning, I go to work, and Ecto-1, our old Cadillac, is gone, his neutrona thrower, collider pack, all the traps, 16 ounces of fuel isotope, all gone! He cleaned us out.',
'Now we were the dead ones.',
'Well, don’t you think he might have had a reason?',
'He phoned me about ten years later. Some small town in Oklahoma.',
'He kept rambling about “the rising storm” and “the huge psychic tornado” that was gonna “consume humanity in darkness forever”.',
'Now—now—and, kid, I wanted to believe—',
'You don’t understand. There is this mountain, and it has these ancient carvings, and—',
'Kid—Kid—Kid—There are a lot of mountains out there with ancient carvings.',
'Take a little advice. Don’t go chasing ghosts.',
'Egon Spengler was my grandfather.',
'Time’s up.',
'Hey! Hello?',
'Where are my kids?!',
'They’re in the lockup.',
'Uh! My children are not criminals!',
'Sure they’re not.',
'Driving without a license. Expired registration. Speeding.',
'Well, they can’t be the first to go joyriding!',
'—Saturday night!',
'No, they are not. But they are the first to destroy half of Main Street with whatever the hell that thing is.',
'Whoa!',
'Sorry.',
'What the hell were you thinking?!',
'You know, you two could have… really hurt yourselves.',
'Hey. I’m Gary.',
'You process them out yet?',
'(Did you catch anything?)',
'(It’s inside the trap.)',
'(Right now?)',
'(Yes.)',
'Let’s go! You were supposed to look after her this summer.',
'I was?',
'Not you. Him.',
'This was her idea.',
'Wait, but what about our stuff? The Ecto-1?',
'Everything will remain nice and safe in our impound locker.',
'No! We need it.',
'Phoebe, let’s go!',
'We caught a ghost tonight.',
'Dirt Farmer’s family.',
'It’s true.',
'And there will be more.',
'Be careful, you’re startin’ to sound like your lunatic grandfather.',
'Phoebe!',
'She didn’t mean it.',
'You wanna spend the night in my jail?',
'You can—you can keep it.',
'Go. Now.',
'Trevor.',
'I’ll see you at work.',
'Yeah, see you.',
'All right, you guys. Remember that…',
'Yeah, you got it.',
'I’m sorry the night went sideways.',
'No. I-I had a blast.',
'Why don’t we just pick it up tomorrow night, same time.',
'You really want more of this?',
'Are you kidding me?',
'We had kung pao shrimp. We went to jail. I mean, I don’t know how we’re gonna top this. This is a home run.',
'Um, my life is a dumpster fire.',
'I love dumpster fires. You should see my apartment.',
'I meant—I don’t mean now. Ah—Any—Anytime soon.',
'It’s—You don’t want to—I’d need to clean—',
'This is moving way too fast. You gotta—just—relax.',
'Kids hungry? They want—some of this, uh… un-refrigerated shrimp?',
'We’re barely hanging on here.',
'You don’t understand.',
'I understand you drove around town destroying expensive property.',
'Don’t you think your father came out here for a reason?',
'No… No… I think he was a sad, old man, who turned his back on his family, his partners—And for what?',
'For a stupid farm in a town nobody cares about!',
'Where—by the way—everybody thought he was nuts.',
'Yeah, great decision, Dad.',
'He was special. He loved science, like me!',
'Why didn’t you tell me my grandfather was Egon Spengler?!',
'Hey. I’m glad you found yourself here. I really am.',
'But all I see are reminders that I didn’t mean a thing to him.',
'He never cared about me.',
'He’s not nuts.',
'Well. Then he’s an asshole. Welcome to the family.',
'Yeah…',
'Aiigh!',
'Jamoca.',
'There we go. Strawberry, red velvet… Blue velvet? Heh heh heh…',
'Aah! Aah…!',
'Oh, God.',
'Hey—',
'Aaah…!',
'Okay, so. What exactly… is happenin’ with the map?',
'Do see the concentric circles around the mountain?',
'No…',
'Do you see the circles?',
'Yes.',
'Something’s happening inside that old mine.',
'Yeah. I know that. It’s pretty… obvious.',
'Right, so I did some digging on the word you heard in the mountain. “Gozer”?',
'You did some digging?',
'Gozer was a Sumerian god who once walked amongst the living.',
'A soul-eating, flame-dripping deity of evil. And I think it wants back.',
'Here?',
'I know. I would’ve picked Orlando.',
'What does the name “Ivo Shandor” mean to you guys?',
'Ivo Shandor? He built this whole town.',
'He built… mine, foundry, the… school, library. His name is on everything.',
'That’s tacky.',
'In New York, he created an apartment building made out of selenium girders, mined from right here.',
'On that same rooftop is where our grandfather fought to keep a horde of ghosts from entering our dimension.',
'Phoebe. What exactly is happening here?',
'I can only think of one way for us to find out.',
'So what do a cigarette and hamster have in common?',
'What?',
'They’re both completely harmless until you stick one in your mouth and light it on fire.',
'The worst time.',
'Hey, guys, look.',
'Is that her? Is that Gozer?',
'Gozer isn’t he or she.',
'Pretty woke for 3000 BC.',
'Everyone watch their steps.',
'Another hole?',
'Wonder where this one leads to.',
'A sacrificial death pit!',
'What were they sacrificing?',
'Virgins, probably. Tough luck for you, dude. Sorry.',
'Well, statistically, most fifteen-year-olds are virgins.',
'Shh! Uh…',
'Fifteen? You’re fifteen?',
'I’ll be sixteen in February.',
'It’s June.',
'What are those holes in the wall?',
'They’re vacancies.',
'If this is a tomb, where are all the bodies?',
'Found one!',
'Oh.',
'What?',
'Oh, my God.',
'Is he sleeping?',
'Dude. He’s in a coffin.',
'It’s… Ivo Shandor. He’s been in here for seventy-five years?',
'He looks fantastic.',
'You know when you die, your fingernails actually keep growing.',
'Not true. Your skin just shrinks.',
'Something was coming, and he knew it.',
'I think these are years.',
'1883?',
'The Krakatoa eruption. The most violent volcanic activity in human history.',
'What happened in 1908?',
'Probably the Tunguska blast over Siberia.',
'1945.',
'What didn’t happen?',
'1984. Ghosts attack New York City.',
'The Manhattan Cross-Rip.',
'It’s a countdown.',
'Uh, like a… prophecy?',
'Do you guys hear that?',
'Yeah, I do.',
'I think it’s coming from the death pit.',
'Phoebe.',
'Phoebe!',
'The earthquakes.',
'Oh! Oh! Oh! My gosh!',
'Phoebe!!',
'Phoebe…!',
'Phoebe…!!',
'I think he’s alive.',
'Are you okay?',
'Yeah. Yeah.',
'Are you?',
'Yeah.',
'Pheebs, what’s wrong?',
'He was right all along.',
'What do you mean?',
'Our grandfather.',
'He was right here—He built this!',
'He was standing guard, even when no one believed him.',
'He sacrificed everything.',
'His life… His friends… Us.',
'Bummer.',
'Dude.',
'We need to tell Mom.',
'Phoebe…?',
'Pheebs?',
'Mom?!',
'Mom?',
'(There is no Mom. There is only Zuul.)',
'Mom. Are you okay?',
'There is no Mom!! There is only Zuul!!',
'What’s happening right now?',
'Mom…?',
'Is she okay?',
'Mom??',
'Are you the Keymaster?!',
'Um. I don’t know.',
'Mom!',
'Phoebe, what do I do?',
'Mom, stop!',
'Whoa!!',
'Mom!!',
'What the hell… is going on?',
'What is all this?',
'This isn’t a farm.',
'It’s a trap.',
'What?',
'Nothing.',
'This is what he’s been working on all those years.',
'What, building this model?',
'The detail is amazing.',
'No, he came here to finish what the original Ghostbusters started.',
'To trap Gozer.',
'Out in that dirt field.',
'Exactly. These big silos act as a capacitor.',
'Whoa!',
'Uh, what’s a capacitor?',
'Would it kill you to read?',
'Would it kill you to just tell me?',
'Once activated, these towers can hold a charge for one moment. But in that one moment, they can power hundreds of traps.',
'So how do we get Gozer into the field?',
'Gozer’s protected by two evil spirits.',
'The Keymaster and the Gatekeeper.',
'She needs both of them. No Gatekeeper, no Gozer.',
'But first these spirits must possess two human souls.',
'Like Mom.',
'So they can unite. Formally.',
'What are we talking about?',
'We’re thinking at least third base.',
'Go, Mom.',
'I like your eyes!!',
'Growl!! Grr-owl!!',
'Thanks!!',
'They were just here.',
'There she is.',
'Got anything?',
'No, just more stupid guns.',
'A jail inside a jail.',
'What are you talking about?',
'No! No, no, no!',
'It’s an ANSI class-one electromagnetic deadbolt.',
'I believe in you.',
'It’s unpickable.',
'What are you doing?',
'I… have a plan.',
'Wait!',
'Come on, let’s go.',
'Ready?',
'I’ll be waiting.',
'That’s my mom.',
'What?',
'Your Eminence.',
'Goddess of Gods.',
'I have built this temple for you.',
'So that you might return to earth.',
'And together… We… We can rule the world.',
'Excuse me…?',
'Uh… Par-pardon me…?',
'Yeah, hi… Uh…',
'What do you call a fish with no eyes?',
'A fsh…',
'Uh… A whale…',
'There’s two whales in a bar. And one of them goes, “Ooooh-wooo-ooh…',
'And then the other one goes, “Go home. You’re drunk.”',
'Uh…',
'(Okay.)',
'Uhm… So a grasshopper walks into a bar.',
'And then the bartender’s like, “We have a drink named after you!”',
'And then the grasshopper’s like, “You have a drink named Steve?!”',
'Have you come to offer yourself… in sacrifice?!',
'What?',
'Are you prepared to die?!',
'No, I’m twelve.',
'Are you?',
'Mom!!',
'Wait! Wait! Wha—What’s going on?! What—What’s happening?! Where am I?!',
'Hey…!',
'Mom, it’s okay.',
'You were kind of possessed.',
'Possessed?!',
'And you turned into a dog.',
'Then you got kinda humpy.',
'Humpy?',
'Hold on!',
'Oh, Phoebe! Phoebe! There’s this, um—there’s this basement—this secret basement—!',
'Mom, we know.',
'With all these computers and this equipment—!',
'Isn’t that place insane?',
'Yes! And… And it seemed like he had a plan!',
'We’re aware.',
'Oh! Oh and there were all these photos—these photos of me, like—like he was tracking my entire life.',
'How rewarding.',
'Super news. We wanna hear about it.',
'Yeah, but we’re kinda tryin’ to save the world right now.',
'Oh. Okay, cool. I’m in. Uh, how can I help?',
'No!',
'What the hell was that?',
'That was your boyfriend Gary.',
'Boyfriend?',
'Inside that trap is the Gatekeeper.',
'Gatekeeper?',
'If the Gatekeeper and the Keymaster reunite…',
'Keymaster?',
'One second.',
'Phoebe… You’re a… You’re a…',
'I’m a scientist.',
'Oh. We got her!',
'Yes!',
'This was Grandpa’s plan.',
'Uh… Comin’ in hot!',
'Mom, come on!',
'Oh, my God.',
'Get back. Get back.',
'Mom.',
'What’s up?',
'Hey.',
'No, no, no, no, no.',
'Pull the lever.',
'Hey!',
'Come on, what are you waiting for?!',
'I’m waiting for this thing to work! It’s not working!',
'Uh…',
'Mom, hit the pedal!',
'Pedal?',
'Lucky!',
'Podcast, what are you doing?!',
'I’ve got my own problems!',
'Oh, no.',
'No!',
'Hey, flattop.',
'Have you missed us?',
'Gozer the Gozerian!',
'In the name of the County of Summerville, State of Oklahoma, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, all the members of Ducks Unlimited, the Association for the Advancement of Retired Persons, I command you under the National Invasive Species Act to depart this world immediately.',
'Bravo.',
'I think she remembers us.',
'Are you… a god?!',
'Ray?',
'Oh, come on, Ray.',
'Yes.',
'Yeah, we’re all gods.',
'Yeah, I mean, we’re all pretty dang special down here.',
'On a personal note, I thought that we had busted up for good.',
'I mean, it wasn’t working for me. My friends didn’t think so. I know yours didn’t.',
'Okay, playtime’s over. Let’s toast this muffin.',
'Light them up.',
'Man, I love that sound.',
'On the count of three. Go on “two”. One… Two…',
'Yeah, nothing stings like a billion electron volts!',
'Yes!',
'Do you feel that?',
'Yeah.',
'Uh-oh.',
'She’s uncrossing the streams!',
'No!',
'Oh!',
'Are they dead?',
'I don’t remember this job being so painful.',
'I do.',
'You got a lot of nerve.',
'Comin’ back here, crawlin’ back to me.',
'We could’ve been the most spectacular power couple.',
'You know. My sense of fun and your personality.',
'But, no, you always had to vanquish! And conquer!',
'Always had to maim somebody!',
'And that’s probably the number one reason why—!',
'Ah, good try anyway.',
'Now we’re finished, babe. We’re finished.',
'No!',
'Come on, Phoebe!',
'(Holy shit.)',
'We’re on!',
'I thought you might turn up.',
'I’m sorry. I didn’t believe you.',
'I should’ve called. I miss you, my friend.',
'Are you okay?! Oh, my God. You scared the shit out of me.',
'Mom. I can’t breathe… Okay.',
'Hi there.',
'Pete Venkman from the home office.',
'Thanks for pitchin’ in.',
'You’re welcome.',
'I like your style.',
'Who’s that one?',
'Callie. Callie Spengler.',
'Spengler? Huh. Weird name. Try to make the best of that.',
'All right. We’re gonna have cocoa inside.',
'And some of us will have rum with it.',
'Lucky!',
'Oh!',
'Hey…! Hey, man…!',
'Are you okay?',
'Yeah, I… Yeah.',
'My hands hurt from galloping.',
'Oh, my God… I totally thought I lost you.',
'Sorry about that.',
'Well, that was weird.',
'Mmm-hmm. Yeah.',
'I’m bleeding. Why am I bleeding?',
'Um, you headbutted a park bench.',
'Oh, right, yeah.',
'Yeah.',
'Hi.',
'Hi…',
'Um, back there. Yeah…',
'Yeah…',
'I mean, before we… became dogs and… opened the gates of hell, I think that maybe we, uh…',
'Yeah. Yeah, I think so too.',
'But then we saved the world, so…',
'That’s true.',
'Are you all right, son?',
'You just single-handedly defeated a manifestation of Gozer.',
'You gotta be on my podcast!',
'Sure, what’s it called?',
'Mystical Tales of the Unknown Universe!',
'M.T. Double-U., that’s you?',
'Wait. You’re my subscriber?!',
'Really found its voice in the forty-sixth episode.',
'What did they do to you?',
'Don’t worry. I’ll take you home, get you all cleaned up.',
'Go.',
'Hey…',
'for HAROLD',
'GHOSTBUSTERS',
'Written by GIL KENAN & JASON REITMAN',
'Tell me what this is.',
'Lines.',
'Two… No, three… wavy lines.',
'It’s amazing.',
'You’re amazing. With your ability to… flood my psychic powers.',
'I can’t believe you used to shock your students.',
'Between us, I only zapped the guys.',
'Aah!',
'It’s flawed science. I know that now. I admit that.',
'Ready? Try this one.',
'Take a moment.',
'Uh…',
'It’s a five-pointed star. Yes?',
'How are you doing that?',
'Some believe that true love imbues a subject with the ability…',
'Ah…!',
'Did you mark the cards?',
'No.',
'You did, didn’t you?',
'Yeah.',
'It works well.',
'I want you to take this.',
'What is it?',
'It’s a souvenir from the World’s Fair at Flushing Meadow in 1964.',
'It’s my lucky coin.',
'I shouldn’t take it. We might not be coming back.',
'Take it anyway. I got another one at home.',
'Egon was the brains.',
'Ray was the heart.',
'Peter just kept it cool.',
'Who were you?',
'The sex appeal.',
'You’ve done very well for yourself.',
'A lot of shelf space.',
'Well, see, that’s the thing.',
'I don’t do it for me.',
'I do it for my kids, and… I wanna be an example of what’s possible.',
'You still covering the rent at Ray’s bookshop?',
'Ray’s gonna turn a profit one of these days.',
'Ha ha. I remember the day you came in.',
'I came in lookin’ for a steady paycheck.',
'But busting ghosts with the guys… taught me not to be afraid. That I had the tools, and I had the talent.',
'I started this business with one employee.',
'And I’ve grown it into a thriving global enterprise.',
'I may be a businessman, but I will always be a Ghostbuster.',
