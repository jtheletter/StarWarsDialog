'October is inventory time. So right now, Statler Toyota is making the best deals of the year on all 1985-model Toyotas.',
'You won’t find a better car at a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley.',
'That’s Statler Toyota in downtown Hill Valley…',
'…The Senate is expected to vote on this today.',
'In other news, officials at the Pacific Nuclear Research Facility have denied the rumor that a case of missing plutonium was in fact stolen from their vault two weeks ago.',
'A Libyan terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the alleged theft. However, officials now attribute the discrepancy to a simple clerical error.',
'The FBI, which is investigating the matter, had no comment…',
'Hey, Doc?',
'Doc?',
'Hello, anybody home?',
'Einstein, come here, boy.',
'What’s going on? What—oh, God.',
'Aw, Jesus… That is disgusting.',
'Where the hell is he?',
'Wha-hoh.',
'Rock ‘n’ roll.',
'Yo.',
'Marty, is that you?!',
'Hey. Hey, Doc. Where are you?',
'Thank God I found you.',
'Listen. Can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I made a major breakthrough, and I’ll need your assistance.',
'Wait, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?',
'Yeah.',
'Doc, what’s going on? Where you been all week?',
'Workin’.',
'Where’s Einstein? Is he with you?',
'Yeah, he’s right here.',
'You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.',
'My equipment? That reminds me, Marty. You better not hook up to the amplifier. There’s a slight possibility of overload.',
'Yeah. I’ll keep that in mind.',
'Good. I’ll see you tonight. Don’t forget now! 1:15 AM, Twin Pines Mall.',
'Right.',
'Are those my clocks I hear?!',
'Yeah! Uh… It’s… 8:00!',
'Perfect! My experiment worked! They’re all exactly twenty-five minutes slow!',
'Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc! Are you telling me that it’s 8:25?!',
'Precisely.',
'Damn… I’m late for school!',
'Yo, Jennifer—',
'Marty, don’t go this way. Strickland’s looking for you. If you get caught, it’ll be four tardies in a row.',
'All right, come on! I think we’re safe.',
'You know, this time it wasn’t my fault. The doc set all his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.',
'Doc?',
'Am I to understand you’re still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly?',
'Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker.',
'And one for you, McFly. I believe that makes four in a row.',
'Let me give you a nickel’s worth of free advice, young man.',
'This so-called Doctor Brown is dangerous. He’s a real nutcase.',
'You hang around with him, you’re gonna end up in big trouble.',
'Oh, yes, sir—',
'You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You’re a slacker!',
'You remind me of your father when he went here. He was a slacker too.',
'Can I go now, Mister Strickland?',
'I noticed your band is on the roster for the dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You don’t have a chance. You’re too much like your old man.',
'No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.',
'Yeah, well, history is gonna change.',
'Next, please.',
'Okay, guys, let’s go.',
'All right.',
'We’re the, uh… We’re the Pinheads.',
'One, two, three.',
'Okay, that’s enough.',
'Uh, thank you, thank you, fellas. Hold it. Hold it, fellas.',
'I’m afraid you’re just too darn loud.',
'Next, please. Bring the next group, please.',
'Re-elect Mayor “Goldie” Wilson. Progress is his middle name…',
'“Too loud.” I can’t believe it.',
'I’m never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.',
'Marty, one rejection isn’t the end of the world.',
'Nah, I just don’t think I’m cut out for music.',
'But you’re good, Marty. You’re really good.',
'And this audition tape of yours is great. You’ve gotta send it in to the record company.',
'It’s like Doc’s always saying—',
'Yeah, I know, I know. “If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything”…',
'That’s good advice, Marty.',
'All right, okay, Jennifer. What—what if I send in the tape and they don’t like it? I mean what if they say I’m no good?',
'What if they say, “Get out of here, kid, you got no future”? I mean, I just don’t think I can take that kind of rejection.',
'Jesus, I’m starting to sound like my old man.',
'Come on. He’s not that bad.',
'Save the clock tower.',
'At least he’s letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.',
'Save the clock tower?',
'Check out that four-by-four! That is hot.',
'Okay. Back her up.',
'Someday, Jennifer. Someday.',
'Wouldn’t it be great? Take that truck… up to the lake?',
'Throw a couple of… sleeping bags in the back.',
'Lie out underneath the stars?',
'Stop it.',
'What?',
'Does your mom know? About tomorrow night?',
'Nah, get out of town! My mom thinks I’m going camping with the guys.',
'Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you, and I’d get the standard lecture about… how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. I mean, look… I think the woman was born a nun.',
'She’s just trying to keep you respectable.',
'Well, she’s not doing a very good job.',
'Terrible.',
'Save the clock tower! Save the clock tower!',
'Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock.',
'Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower, and the clock hasn’t run since.',
'We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage—',
'There you go, lady. There’s a quarter.',
'Thank you. Don’t forget to take a flier!',
'Right…',
'Save the clock tower!',
'Where were we?',
'Right about here.',
'Jennifer!',
'It’s my dad.',
'Right.',
'I’ve got to go.',
'I’ll call you tonight!',
'Uh—I’ll be at my grandma’s! Here, let me give you the number.',
'Bye.',
'…License: California. Bravo, Tango, Delta, 6-2-9. Tow for impoundment. Uh, any unit, please respond.',
'Perfect. Just perfect.',
'I can’t believe you’d loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot!',
'Blind spot?',
'I could’ve been killed!',
'Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed that, uh, the car had any blind spot before when I would drive it. (Hi, Son.)',
'Well, what, are you blind, McFly? It’s there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?!',
'Now, Biff, um, can I—can I assume that your, uh, insurance is going to pay for the damage?',
'Wh—my insurance? It’s your car! Your insurance should pay for it.',
'Eh—I wanna know who’s going to pay for this? I spilled beer all over it when the car smashed into me. Who’s gonna pay my cleaning bill?',
'Uh…',
'And, uh, where’s my reports?',
'Ah… well—I haven’t finished those up yet, but, you know, I—I figured since they weren’t due till—',
'Hello…? Hello…? Anybody home? Huh?',
'Oh, okay…',
'Think, McFly. Think!',
'All right…',
'I gotta have time to get ‘em retyped.',
'Like—Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting?',
'I’ll get fired.',
'You wouldn’t want that to happen, would ya?',
'Would ya?!',
'Oh, of course not, Biff. Now I wouldn’t want that to happen.',
'Now look. I’ll, uh, finish those reports on up tonight, and… I’ll run them on over first thing tomorrow, all right?',
'Hey, not too early. I sleep in Saturday.',
'Oh, McFly, your shoe’s untied… Pppth!',
'Oh! Ah…',
'Don’t be so gullible, McFly.',
'Got the place fixed up nice, though, McFly!',
'Hey, I have your car towed all the way to your house, and all you got for me is lite beer?',
'What are you looking at, butthead?',
'Say hi to your mom for me.',
'I know what you’re going to say, Son.',
'And you’re right! You’re right.',
'But, uh… Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I’m, ah… ‘fraid I’m just not very good at… confrontations.',
'But the car… Dad…',
'I mean, he—he wrecked it. He totaled it.',
'I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad. I mean, do you have any idea how important this was to me? Do you have any clue?',
'I know, and all I can say is, I’m… I’m sorry.',
'Believe me, Marty, you’re… better off without having to worry about all the… aggravation and headaches of… playing at that dance.',
'He’s absolutely right, Marty. The last thing you need… is headaches.',
'Ah—ha—ha—ha—ha…',
'Kids… we’re going to have to eat this cake by ourselves. Your Uncle Joey didn’t make parole again.',
'I think it would be nice if you all dropped him a line.',
'Uncle “Jailbird” Joey?',
'He’s your brother, Mom.',
'Yeah. I think it’s a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.',
'We all make mistakes in life, children.',
'God damn it! I’m late.',
'David, watch your mouth!',
'You come here and kiss your mother before you go. Come here.',
'Oh, come on, Mom. Make it fast. I’ll miss my bus.',
'Hey, see you later, Pop.',
'Whew! Hah, time to change that oil.',
'Ah—ha—ha—ha…',
'Hey, Marty.',
'I’m not your answering service. But you were outside pouting over the car… Jennifer Parker called you twice.',
'I don’t like her, Marty.',
'Any girl who calls up a boy is just asking for trouble.',
'Oh, Mother, there’s nothing wrong with calling a boy.',
'I think it’s terrible… Girls chasing boys!',
'When I was your age, I never chased a boy or called a boy or… sat in a parked car with a boy.',
'Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody?',
'Well, it’ll just happen. Like the way I met your father.',
'That was so stupid! Grandpa hit him with the car.',
'It was meant to be.',
'Anyway… If Grandpa hadn’t hit him, then none of you would have been born.',
'Yeah, well… I still don’t understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.',
'What was it, George? Birdwatching?',
'What, Lorraine? What?',
'Anyway, your Grandpa hit him with the car… and brought him into the house.',
'He seemed so helpless… like a little lost puppy, and my heart just went out to him.',
'Yeah, Mom, we know. You’ve told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him, so you decided to go with him to the “Fish Under the Sea” dance.',
'No, no. It was the “Enchantment Under the Sea” dance.',
'Our first date… I’ll never forget it.',
'It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember, George?',
'Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor.',
'It was then that I realized… that I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.',
'Ah—ha—ha—ha—ah—ha—oh—ha…',
'Hello.',
'Marty, you didn’t fall asleep, did you?',
'Uh… Doc! Uh, no. No, don’t be silly.',
'Listen, this is very important. I forgot my video camera. Can you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?',
'Uh, yeah. Um, on my way.',
'Einstein! Hey, Einstein, where’s the doc, boy, huh?',
'Doc!',
'Marty! You made it!',
'Yeah!',
'Welcome to my latest experiment. This is the big one, the one I’ve been waiting for all my life!',
'Uh, well, it’s a DeLorean, right—?',
'Stay with me, Marty. All your questions will be answered. Roll tape, and we’ll proceed.',
'Uh, Doc. Uh, is that a Devo—?',
'Never mind that now, never mind that now. Not now, not now.',
'All right, I’m ready.',
'Good evening. I’m Doctor Emmett Brown. I’m standing on the parking lot at Twin Pines Mall.',
'It’s Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 AM. And this is temporal experiment number one.',
'Come on, Einie! Hey, hey, boy. Get in there. Attaboy.',
'In you go. Sit down. Put your seat belt on. That’s it.',
'Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Okay.',
'Please note… that Einstein’s clock is in precise synchronization with my control watch. Got it?',
'Right. Check, Doc.',
'Good.',
'Have a good trip, Einstein. Watch your head.',
'You got that thing hooked up to the… car?',
'Watch this.',
'Yeah. Yeah.',
'Not me! The car! The car!',
'My calculations are correct… when this baby hits 88 miles per hour… you’re gonna see some serious shit.',
'Watch this. Watch this.',
'Ah! What did I tell you?! 88 miles per hour!!',
'The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20 AM and zero seconds!',
'Ah—Jeez Christ. Jesus Christ, Doc—you disintegrated Einstein!',
'Calm down, Marty! I didn’t disintegrate anything!',
'The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact!',
'Then where the hell are they?!',
'The appropriate question is, “When the hell are they?”!',
'You see, Einstein has just become the world’s first time traveler!',
'I sent him… into the future!',
'One minute into the future, to be exact.',
'At precisely… 1:21 AM and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine!',
'Wait a minute… Wait a minute, Doc… Ah…',
'Are you telling me that you built a time machine… out of a DeLorean?!',
'The way I see it, if you’re going to build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style?',
'Besides, the stainless-steel construction made the flux dispersal—Look out!',
'What?! What?! Is it hot?!',
'It’s cold. Damn cold.',
'Ah, ha ha. Einstein, you little devil!',
'Einstein’s clock is exactly one minute behind mine and still ticking!!',
'He’s all right.',
'He’s fine. And he’s completely unaware that anything happened.',
'As far as he’s concerned, the trip was instantaneous.',
'That’s why his watch is exactly one minute behind mine.',
'He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time.',
'Come here. I’ll show you how it works.',
'All right.',
'First… you turn the time circuits on.',
'This readout tells you where you’re going. This one tells you where you are. This one tells you where you were.',
'You input your destination time on this keypad.',
'Say… you want to see the signing of the Declaration of Independence.',
'Or witness the birth of Christ!',
'Here’s a red-letter date in the history of science: November 5, 1955.',
'Yes, of course. November 5, 1955.',
'What? I don’t get—What happened?',
'That was the day I invented time travel.',
'I remember it vividly.',
'I was standing on the edge of my toilet, hanging a clock. The porcelain was wet. I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink… and when I came to, I had a revelation. A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this!',
'This is what makes time travel possible: the flux capacitor.',
'Flux capacitor?',
'It’s taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day.',
'My God, has it been that long?',
'Things have certainly changed around here.',
'I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see.',
'Old Man Peabody… owned all of this.',
'He had this crazy idea… about breeding pine trees.',
'This is, uh… This is heavy-duty, Doc. This is great.',
'Ah… Does it run, like, on, uh, regular unleaded gasoline?',
'Unfortunately, no. It requires something with a little more kick: plutonium!',
'Uh, plutonium. Wait a minute. Are you…',
'Are you telling me that this sucker is nuclear?!',
'Hey, hey, hey! Keep rolling! Keep rolling there!',
'No, no, no, no, no. This sucker’s electrical! But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need!',
'Doc, you don’t just walk into a store and—and buy plutonium!',
'Did you rip that off?!',
'Of course. From a group of Libyan nationalists.',
'They wanted me to build them a bomb. So I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shoddy bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts!',
'Come on! Let’s get you a radiation suit! We must prepare to reload!',
'Safe now. Everything’s lead-lined.',
'Don’t you lose those tapes now. I need that… as a record.',
'Let’s put this back here, there we go.',
'Oh! Oh! I almost forgot my luggage.',
'I mean, who knows if they’ve got cotton underwear in the future? I’m allergic to all synthetics.',
'The future? That’s where you’re going?',
'That’s right. Twenty-five years into the future.',
'I’ve always dreamed of seeing the future, looking beyond my years… seeing the progress of mankind.',
'Why not?',
'I’ll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five World Series.',
'Uh, Doc.',
'Huh?',
'Uh, look me up… when you get there.',
'Indeed I will. Roll ‘em.',
'I… Doctor Emmett Brown… am about to embark on an historic journey…',
'What am I thinking of? I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium!',
'How did I ever expect to get back?! One pellet, one trip! I must be out of my mind…!',
'What is it, Einie?',
'Oh, my God. They found me. I don’t know how, but they found me.',
'Run for it, Marty!',
'Who?! Who?!',
'Who do you think?! The Libyans!!',
'Holy shit!!',
'I’ll draw their fire!!',
'Doc, wait!!',
'No!!! You bastard!!',
'Go!! Damn Soviet gun! Go!!',
'Come on, move! Damn it!',
'Jeez! Ugh!',
'Holy shit!',
'Let’s see if you bastards can do 90.',
'Aargh! …Aargh…!',
'Wh—What is it? Wh—What is it, Pa?',
'Looks like a airplane… without wings.',
'Dat ain’ no airplane. Look.',
'Aargh!! Ah—Aargh!!',
'Listen—Whoa!',
'Hello…? Ah, excuse me.',
'Sorry about your barn.',
'It’s already mutated into human form—shoot it!!',
'Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!!',
'My pine! Why, you…!',
'You space bastard! You killed our pine!',
'All right, all right. Okay, McFly. Get a grip on yourself.',
'It’s all a dream. It’s just a… very… intense dream.',
'Whoa, whoa. Listen, you got to help me.',
'Don’t stop, Wilbur! Don’t…!',
'Can’t be.',
'This is nuts.',
'Ah, come on.',
'Perfect.',
'…Remember, fellow citizens: The future is in your hands.',
'If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor “Red” Thomas. Progress is his middle name.',
'Mayor “Red” Thomas’s progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes.',
'On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader. Re-elect Mayor “Red” Thomas…',
'This has gotta be a dream.',
'Hey, kid. What’d you do, jump ship?',
'What?',
'Well, what’s with the life preserver?',
'I just want to use the phone.',
'Eh, it’s in the back.',
'Brown… Great. You’re alive.',
'Come on.',
'Do you know where 1640 Riverside—',
'Are you gonna order somethin’, kid?!',
'Uh, yeah. Gimme—gimme a Tab.',
'Tab? I can’t give you a tab unless you order somethin’.',
'Right. Give me a… Pepsi Free.',
'If you want a Pepsi, pal, you’re gonna pay for it.',
'Look, just give me somethin’ without any sugar in it, okay?',
'Somethin’ without sugar.',
'Hey, McFly.',
'What d’you think you’re doin’?',
'Biff.',
'Hey, I’m talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug!',
'Oh, hey, Biff. Hey, guys. How are you doing?',
'Hey, you got my homework finished, McFly?',
'Ah… well, actually, I figured since it wasn’t due till Monday, I—',
'Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh?',
'Eh—Think, McFly. Think.',
'I gotta have time to re-copy it.',
'You realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting?',
'I’ll get kicked out of school.',
'Uh, you wouldn’t want that to happen, would ya?',
'Would ya?!',
'Well, no, of course not, Biff.',
'No, no…',
'I wouldn’t want that to happen.',
'Well, what are you looking at, butthead?!',
'Hey, Biff, get a load of this guy’s life preserver. Dork thinks he’s going to drown.',
'So, uh, how ‘bout my homework, McFly?',
'Ah… Okay, Biff. Well, I’ll, uh, I’ll finish that on up tonight, and then I’ll, uh, bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.',
'Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.',
'Oh, McFly, your shoe’s untied—oh, ah!',
'Don’t be so gullible, McFly.',
'Okay.',
'I don’t want to see you in here again.',
'Okay. All right, bye-bye.',
'What?!',
'You’re George McFly.',
'Yeah, who are you?',
'Say! Why do you let those boys push you around like that for?',
'Well, they’re bigger than me.',
'Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself.',
'Don’t you know, if you let people walk over you now, they’ll be walking over you for the rest of your life.',
'Look at me. You think I’m gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?',
'Watch it, Goldie.',
'No, sir! I’m gonna make somethin’ of myself. I’m goin’ to night school. An’ one day, I’m goin’ to be somebody.',
'That’s right. He’s gonna be mayor!',
'Yeah, I’ma… Mayor!',
'Now that’s a good idea! I could run for mayor!',
'A colored mayor. That’ll be the day.',
'You wait an’ see, Mister Caruthers! I will be mayor. I’ll be the most powerful man in Hill Valley. An’ I’m gonna clean up this town.',
'Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.',
'Mayor “Goldie” Wilson. I like the sound of that.',
'Hey, Dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!',
'He’s a peeping Tom.',
'Dad!',
'Hey, wait. Wait a minute. Who are you?',
'Stella! Another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car!',
'Come on out here! Help me take him in the house!',
'Mom? That you?',
'There, there, now. Just relax.',
'You’ve been asleep for almost nine hours now.',
'I had a… horrible nightmare. Dreamed I went… back in time. It was terrible.',
'Well… You’re safe and sound now, back in good-old 1955.',
'1955?!',
'You’re my muh… You’re my muh…',
'My name is Lorraine. Lorraine Baines.',
'Yeah! But you’re, ah… You’re so, ah… You’re so… thin!',
'Just relax, Calvin. You got a big bruise on your head.',
'Ah! Where are my pants?!',
'Over there… on my hope chest.',
'I’ve never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.',
'Calvin? Why—Why do you keep calling me Calvin?',
'Well, that is your name, isn’t it? Calvin Klein? It’s written all over your underwear.',
'Aargh!',
'Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?',
'No, actually, people… call me Marty.',
'Oh… Pleased to meet you, Calvin… Marty… Klein.',
'Do you mind if I sit here?',
'No! Fine. No! Good. Fine. Good.',
'That’s uh, a big bruise you have there—',
'Lorraine, are you up there?',
'Oh, my God! It’s my mother!',
'Quick! Put your pants back on!',
'So, tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?',
'Excuse me?',
'Oh, I guessed you’re a sailor. That’s why you wear that life preserver.',
'Uh, Coast Guard…',
'Sam… Here’s the young man you hit with your car out there. He’s all right, thank God.',
'What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age?!',
'Oh, don’t pay attention to him. He’s in one of his moods.',
'Sam! You’ll quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner!',
'Now, let’s see. You already know Lorraine.',
'This is Milton, this is Sally, that’s Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.',
'So, you’re my uncle Joey.',
'Better get used to these bars, kid.',
'Yes… Joey just loves being in his playpen.',
'He cries whenever we take him out, so we just leave him in there all the time.',
'Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.',
'Uh, listen, I really ought to—',
'Sit here, Marty!',
'Sam, stop fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner!',
'Oh, ho ho! Look at it roll! Now we can watch Jackie Gleason while we eat!',
'It’s our first television set. Dad just picked it up today.',
'Do you have a television?',
'Well, yeah, you know we have… two of ‘em.',
'Wow! You must be rich.',
'Oh, honey, he’s teasing you. Nobody has two television sets.',
'Hey! Hey, I’ve seen this one. I’ve seen this one! This is a classic. This is, ah, where Ralph dresses up as a man from space.',
'What do you mean, you’ve seen this? It’s brand new.',
'Yeah, well, I saw it on a… rerun.',
'What’s a rerun?',
'You’ll find out.',
'You know, Marty, you look so familiar to me. Do I know your mother?',
'Yeah, I think maybe you do.',
'Oh, well, then I want to give her a call. I don’t want her to worry about you.',
'You can’t! Uh… That is, uh, nobody, uh… nobody’s home.',
'Oh…',
'Yet.',
'Oh.',
'Uh, listen… Do you—do you know where Riverside Drive is?',
'It’s, uh, on the other end of town. A block past Maple. East end of town.',
'Wait a minute, a block past Maple. That’s, uh, that’s John F. Kennedy Drive.',
'Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?',
'Um, Mother? Uh, w—with Marty’s parents out of town… Don’t you think he ought to spend the night? I mean, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car.',
'That’s true, Marty. I think maybe you should spend the night. I think you’re our responsibility.',
'Ah, gee, I don’t know…',
'And he can sleep in my room.',
'I gotta go! Uh… I gotta go! Thanks very much. It was wonderful. You were all great. Uh, see you all later… Much later.',
'He’s a very strange young man.',
'He’s an idiot. Comes from upbringing. His parents are probably idiots too.',
'Lorraine, you ever have a kid who acts that way, I’ll disown you.',
'Doc?',
'Don’t say a word.',
'Doc!',
'I don’t wanna know your name. I don’t want to know anything about you.',
'Listen, Doc—',
'Quiet!',
'Doc—!',
'Don’t tell me anything!',
'Doc! You got to help—!',
'Quiet. Quiet.',
'I’m gonna read your thoughts.',
'Let’s see now. You’ve… come here from… a great distance?',
'Yeah, exactly!',
'Don’t tell me!',
'You want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?',
'No!',
'Not a word! Not a word! Not a word now! Quiet.',
'Uh… Donations! You want me to make a donation… to the Coast Guard Youth Auxiliary!',
'Doc. I’m from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented.',
'Now I need your help to get back to the year 1985.',
'My God… Do you know what this means?',
'It means that this damn thing doesn’t work at all!',
'Doc, you got to help me. You are the only one who knows how your time machine works.',
'Time machine… I haven’t invented any time machine…',
'Okay, all right, I’ll prove it to you.',
'Look at my driver’s license: “Expires 1987”.',
'Look at my birthdate, for crying out loud—I haven’t even been born yet!',
'And… look at this picture. It’s my brother, my sister, and me. Look at her sweatshirt, Doc: “Class of 1984”.',
'Pretty mediocre photographic fakery. They cut off your brother’s hair!',
'I’m telling the truth, Doc. You got to believe me!',
'Then tell me… future boy, hah… Who’s president of the United States in 1985?',
'Ronald Reagan.',
'Ronald Reagan? The actor?! Ha!',
'Then who’s vice president? Jerry Lewis?',
'I suppose Jane Wyman is the first lady.',
'Whoa, wait—Doc!',
'And Jack Benny is secretary of the treasury.',
'Doc, you gotta listen to me!',
'I’ve had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy!',
'No, wait, Doc. Doc. The—The bruise! The bruise on your head! I know how that happened, you told me the whole story.',
'You were standing on your toilet, and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink!',
'And that’s when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which… is what makes time travel possible.',
'There’s somethin’ wrong with the starter, so I hid it… here.',
'After I fell off my toilet… I drew this.',
'The flux capacitor.',
'It works! Ah, ha! Ha ha ha! It works!!',
'I finally invent something that works!',
'You bet your ass it works.',
'Somehow we’ve gotta sneak this back to my laboratory.',
'We’ve got to get you home!',
'‘Kay, Doc, this is it.',
'Never mind that. Never mind that now. Never mind that. Never mind.',
'Why, that’s me!',
'Look at me! I’m an old man!',
'Good evening. I’m Doctor Emmett Brown. I’m standing here on the… parking lot at Twin…',
'Thank God, I still got my hair.',
'Wh—What on earth is this thing I’m wearing?',
'Uh, this—this is a radiation suit.',
'Radiation suit? Of course! Because of all the fallout from the atomic wars.',
'This… is truly amazing. A portable television studio.',
'No wonder your president has to be an actor. He’s got to look good on television.',
'Whoa. This is it. This is the part coming up, Doc.',
'No, no, no! This sucker’s electrical! But I need a nuclear reaction to—to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity—',
'What did I just say?!',
'The flux capacitor stores—',
'This sucker’s electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to—to generate the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity—',
'1.21 gigawatts!! 1.21 gigawatts! Great Scott!',
'What?! What the hell is a gigawatt?!',
'How could I have been so careless?! 1.21 gigawatts!',
'Tom, how am I going to generate that kind of power?! It can’t be done, can it?!',
'Doc! Look! All we need is a little plutonium.',
'Oh! I’m sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore! But in 1955, it’s a little hard to come by!',
'Marty, I’m sorry, but I’m afraid you’re stuck here!',
'Whoa. Whoa, Doc. Stuck here?! I can’t—I can’t be stuck here! I got a life in—in 1985! I got a girl!',
'Is she pretty?',
'Doc, she’s beautiful. Sh—She’s crazy about me.',
'Look at this. Look what she wrote here, Doc. I mean… that says it all.',
'Doc… You’re my only hope.',
'Marty, I’m sorry. But the only power source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning!',
'What did you say?',
'A bolt of lightning!',
'Unfortunately, you never know when or where it’s ever going to strike.',
'We do now.',
'This is it! This… is the answer!',
'It says here… that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower at precisely 10:04 PM next Saturday night!',
'If we could somehow… harness this lightning… channel it into the flux capacitor… it just might work!',
'Next Saturday night, we’re sending you back to the future!',
'Okay, all right! Saturday’s good. Saturday’s good. I can spend a week in 1955! I can hang out. You can show me around—',
'Marty. That is completely out of the question. You must not leave this house!',
'You must not see anybody or talk to anybody! Anything you do can have serious repercussions on future events! Do you understand?',
'Yeah… Sure. ‘Kay.',
'Marty. Have you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?',
'I’m… Yeah, well, I might’ve—sort of—bumped into my parents.',
'Great Scott! Let me see that photograph again of your brother!',
'Just as I thought! This proves my theory! Look at your brother!',
'His head’s gone. It’s like—it’s like it’s been erased.',
'Erased from existence.',
'Whoa! They really cleaned this place up. Looks brand new.',
'Now remember: According to my theory, you interfered with your parents’ first meeting.',
'If they don’t meet, they won’t fall in love, they won’t get married, and they won’t have kids.',
'That’s why your older brother’s disappearing from that photograph. Your sister will follow, and unless you repair the damage, you’ll be next.',
'Sounds pretty heavy.',
'Weight has nothing to do with it.',
'Which one’s your pop?',
'That’s him.',
'Okay. Okay, you guys. Oh, ha ha. Very funny. Hey, you guys are being real mature!',
'Maybe you were adopted.',
'Okay, real mature, guys! Okay—can pick up my books.',
'McFly.',
'That’s Strickland… Jesus, didn’t that guy ever have hair?',
'Shape up, man. You’re a slacker. Do you want to be a slacker for the rest of your life?',
'No.',
'What did your mother ever see in that kid?',
'I don’t know, Doc. I—I guess she felt sorry for him ‘cause her dad hit him with the car… hit me with the car.',
'That’s the Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients.',
'Go to it, kid.',
'Hey. George. Buddy. I have been looking all over for you.',
'You remember me? The guy who saved your life the other day?',
'Oh. Yeah.',
'Good. There’s somebody I’d like you to meet.',
'Lorraine?',
'Calvin!',
'I’d like you to meet my good friend George McFly.',
'Hi. It’s really a pleasure to meet you.',
'How’s your head?',
'Well—uh—good. Fine.',
'Oh! I’ve been so worried about you ever since you… ran off the other night. Are you okay?',
'I’m sorry, I have to go.',
'Come on!',
'Isn’t he a dreamboat?',
'Doc, she didn’t even look at him.',
'This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father!',
'Whoa. Wait—wait a minute, Doc. Are you trying to tell me that my mother… has got the hots for me?',
'Precisely!',
'Whoa, this is heavy.',
'There’s that word again, “heavy”.',
'Why are things so heavy in the future? Is there a problem with the earth’s gravitational pull?',
'What?',
'The only way we’re going to get those two to successfully mate is if they’re alone together.',
'So you’ve got to get your father and mother to interact in some… sort of social…',
'Well, what, you mean like a date?',
'Right!',
'Well, what kind of date? I don’t know, what do kids do in the ‘50s?',
'Well, th—they’re your parents. You must know them!',
'What are their common interests? What do they like to do together?',
'Nothing.',
'Look! There’s a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.',
'Of course! The “Enchantment Under the Sea” dance! They’re supposed to go to this! That’s where they kiss for the first time!',
'All right, kid. You stick to your father like glue and make sure he takes her to the dance!',
'George, buddy. Remember that girl I introduced you to… Lorraine?',
'What are you writin’?',
'Uh… Stories… Science fiction stories about, uh, visitors coming down to Earth from other planets.',
'Get out of town! I didn’t know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some.',
'Oh, no, no, no, no. I never let anybody read my stories.',
'Why not?',
'Well, what if they didn’t like them? What if they told me I was no good?',
'I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.',
'Uh, no. No, not hard at all.',
'So, anyway, George—about Lorraine. She really likes you.',
'She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the “Enchantment Under the Sea” dance.',
'Really?',
'Oh, yeah. All you got to do is go over there and ask her.',
'What? Right here, right now, in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don’t know if I could take that kind of a rejection.',
'Besides, I think she’d rather go with somebody else.',
'Uh, who?',
'Biff.',
'Don’t kid around.',
'I’m gonna leave.',
'You want it. You know you want it. You know you want me to give it to you.',
'Shut your filthy mouth. I’m not that kind of girl!',
'Well, maybe you are and you just don’t know it yet.',
'Get your meat hooks off of me.',
'You heard her. She said, get your meat hooks… off… uh, please.',
'So what’s it to you, butthead?',
'You know, you been looking for a fight!',
'Since you’re new here, uh, I’m going to cut you a break… today.',
'So, why don’t you make like a tree… and get out of here.',
'George!',
'Why do you keep following me around?',
'Look, George. I’m telling you, George. If you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I’m gonna regret it for the rest of my life.',
'But I can’t go to the dance. I’ll miss my favorite television program, “Science Fiction Theatre”.',
'Yeah, but, George… Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.',
'Look, I’m just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance. And not you or anybody else on this planet is going to make me change my mind.',
'“Science Fiction Theatre”…',
'Who are you?',
'Silence, Earthling!',
'My name is Darth Vader.',
'I am an extraterrestrial from the planet Vulcan!',
'Marty! Marty! Marty!',
'Hey, George, buddy. You weren’t at school. What’ve you been doin’ all day?',
'I overslept. Look, I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out, but I don’t know how to do it.',
'All right, okay, listen. Keep your pants on, she’s over in the cafe.',
'God, how do you…!',
'What made you change your mind, George?',
'Last night, Darth Vader came down from Planet Vulcan and told me that if I didn’t take Lorraine out, that he’d melt my brain.',
'Yeah, well, uh, let’s just keep this brain-melting stuff to ourselves, okay?',
'Oh, yeah, yeah.',
'All right, okay. All right, there she is, George. Now just go in there and invite her.',
'Okay, but I don’t know what to say.',
'Well, just say anything, George. Say whatever’s natural, the first thing that comes into your mind.',
'Nothing’s coming to my mind.',
'Jesus, George, it’s a wonder I was even born.',
'What, what?',
'Nothing, nothing. Nothing.',
'Look, tell her destiny brought you together. Tell her that she is the most beautiful girl you have ever seen in the world. Girls like that stuff.',
'What are you—what are you doing, George?',
'I’m writing this down. This is good stuff.',
'Yeah. Okay. Let’s go.',
'Can you take care of that?',
'Right.',
'Lou. Give me a milk. Chocolate.',
'Lorraine? My density has popped me to you.',
'What?',
'Oh. What I meant to say was—',
'Wait a minute. Don’t I know you from somewhere?',
'Yes. Yes. I’m George. George McFly. I’m your density.',
'I mean… your destiny.',
'Oh.',
'Hey, McFly!',
'Aw, jeez…',
'I thought I told you never to come in here.',
'Well, it’s going to cost you. How much money you got on you?',
'Well, how much do you want, Biff?',
'Oooh…!',
'All right, punk. Now I’m gonna…',
'Whoa, whoa, Biff. What’s that?',
'That’s Calvin Klein! Oh, my God, he’s a dream!',
'Whoa! Whoa! Kid! Kid! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!',
'Hey!',
'I’ll get it back to you, all right?',
'You broke it!',
'Come back here!',
'Wow! Look at him go!',
'Get him!',
'To the car! To the car! Go! Go!',
'What’s that thing he’s on?',
'It’s a board with wheels.',
'He’s an absolute dream!',
'Come on, come on, come on, come on!',
'Aaah!',
'Whoa!',
'I’m gonna ram him.',
'Shit!!',
'Ooh!',
'Whew!',
'Thanks a lot, kid.',
'I’m gonna get that son of a bitch.',
'Where does he come from?',
'Yeah, where does he live?',
'I don’t know… but I’m gonna find out.',
'Oh, my God. They found me. I don’t know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty! …Oh, my God. They found me. I don’t know how, but they found me. Run for it, Marty!',
'Doc?',
'Oh, hi, Marty. I didn’t hear you come in.',
'Fascinating device, this video unit.',
'Listen, Doc. You know, there’s something I haven’t told you about the night we made that tape—',
'Please, Marty, don’t tell me. No man should know too much about his own destiny!',
'You don’t understand.',
'I do understand. If I know too much about my own future, I can endanger my own existence. Just as you’ve endangered yours!',
'You’re—you’re right.',
'Now. Let me show you my plan for sending you home.',
'Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn’t have time to build it to scale or to paint it.',
'It’s good.',
'Oh, thank you. Thank you. Okay, now.',
'We run some industrial-strength electrical cable from the top of the clock tower down, suspending it over the street between these two lamp posts.',
'Meanwhile, we’ve outfitted the time vehicle with this big pole and hook, which runs directly into the flux capacitor.',
'At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street, driving directly toward the cable, accelerating to 88 miles per hour.',
'According to the flier, at precisely 10:04 PM, this Saturday night, lightning will strike the clock tower, electrifying the cable just as the connecting hook makes contact, thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts into the flux capacitor and sending you back to 1985.',
'All right now. Watch this.',
'You wind up the car and release it. I’ll simulate the lightning.',
'Ready.',
'Set.',
'Release!',
'Ohh!!',
'You’re instilling me with a lot of confidence, Doc.',
'Don’t worry. I’ll take care of the lightning. You just take care of your pop.',
'By the way, what happened today? Did he ask her out?',
'I… think so.',
'What did she say?',
'It’s your mom! She’s tracked you down!',
'Quick, let’s cover the time machine!',
'Hi, Cal—Marty.',
'Mom. Lorraine. Uh… How did you know I was here?',
'I followed you.',
'Oh, uh, this is my, uh, doc—my uncle… Doc… Brown.',
'Hi…',
'Hi.',
'Marty, this may seem a little forward. But I was kind of wondering if… if—if you’d ask me to the… “Enchantment Under the Sea” dance on Saturday.',
'Wow, you mean… you mean nobody’s asked you?',
'No… Not yet…',
'What about—what about George?',
'George McFly?',
'Oh! He’s… kinda cute and all, but, uh, not, well…',
'I think a man should be strong… so he can stand up for himself… and protect the woman he loves… Don’t you?',
'Yeah, uh…',
'I still don’t understand. How am I supposed to go to the dance with her if she’s already going to the dance with you?',
'Because, George, she wants to go with you. She just doesn’t know it yet.',
'That’s why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You’re somebody who’s gonna stand up for yourself, somebody who’s gonna protect her.',
'Yeah, but I’ve never picked a fight in my entire life.',
'Look, you’re not going to be picking a fight, Dad… Dad, dad, daddyio.',
'You’re coming to her rescue, right?',
'Okay, let’s go over the plan again. 8:55, where you gonna be?',
'I’m gonna be at the dance.',
'Right. And where am I gonna be?',
'You’re gonna be in the car with her.',
'Right, okay. So, right around 9:00, she’s gonna get very angry with me.',
'Why is she going to get angry with you?',
'Well, because, George, nice girls get angry when, uh, guys take advantage of them.',
'Oh… You mean you’re gonna go touch her on her…',
'No, no, George, look. It’s just an act! Right?',
'Okay, so, 9:00, you’re strolling through the parking lot. You see us, uh, struggling in the car.',
'You walk up, you open the door, and you say… your line, George.',
'Oh! Uh… Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!',
'You really think I oughta swear?',
'Yes, definitely. God damn it, George. Swear.',
'Okay. So, now. You come up. You punch me in the stomach. I’m out for the count, right?',
'And you and Lorraine live… happily ever after.',
'Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just—I wish I wasn’t so scared.',
'George, there’s nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self-confidence.',
'You know, if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.',
'…Hill Valley area weather this Saturday night: Mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows tonight in the upper 40s…',
'Are you sure about this storm?',
'Since when can weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future?',
'You know, Marty, I’m going to be very sad to see you go.',
'You’ve really made a difference in my life. You’ve given me something to shoot for.',
'Just knowing that I’m gonna be around to see 1985. That I’m going to succeed in this! That I’m going to have a chance to travel through time!',
'It’s going to be really hard waiting thirty years before I can talk to you about everything that’s happened in the past few days.',
'I’m really going to miss you, Marty.',
'I’m really going to miss you.',
'Doc, about the future—',
'No! Marty! We’ve already agreed that having information about the future can be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it can backfire drastically!',
'Whatever you’ve got to tell me, I’ll find out through the natural course of time.',
'“Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be… shot… by terrorists.',
'“Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster.',
'“Your friend, Marty.”',
'Evening, Doctor Brown. Uh, what’s with the wire?',
'Oh, just… little weather experiment.',
'What you got under here?',
'No, no! Don’t touch that! Some new, specialized weather-sensing equipment!',
'You, uh, got a permit for that?',
'Course I do…',
'Just a second. Let me see if I can find it here…',
'Do you mind if we… park… for a while?',
'That’s a great idea. I’d love to park.',
'Huh?!',
'Marty, I’m almost eighteen years old. It’s not like I’ve never parked before.',
'What?!',
'Marty, you seem so nervous. Is something wrong?',
'No! …No.',
'Lorraine! Lorraine! What are you doing?',
'I swiped it from the old lady’s liquor cabinet.',
'Yeah, well… You shouldn’t drink.',
'Why not?',
'Because you… You might regret it… later in life.',
'Marty, don’t be such a square. Everybody who’s anybody drinks.',
'Jeez, you smoke too?!',
'Marty, you’re beginning to sound just like my mother.',
'We goin’ to take a little break, but we’ll be back in a while, so, uh, don’t nobody go nowhere.',
'Marty? Why are you so nervous?',
'Lorraine… Have you ever… uh… been in a situation where you knew you had to act a certain way, but when you… got there, you didn’t know if you could go through with it?',
'Oh, you mean like how you’re supposed to act on a first date?',
'Uh, well, sort of.',
'I think I know exactly what you mean.',
'Y—you do?',
'You know what I do in those situations?',
'What?',
'I don’t worry.',
'This is all wrong.',
'I—I don’t know what it is. But when I kiss you, it’s like I’m kissing… my brother.',
'I guess that doesn’t make any sense, does it?',
'Believe me, it makes perfect sense.',
'Somebody’s coming.',
'You caused three hundred bucks damage to my car, you son of a bitch. An’ I’m gonna take it out of your ass.',
'Hold him.',
'Let him go, Biff. You’re drunk.',
'Well, looky what we have here.',
'No, no! You’re staying right here with me. Come on, Lorraine. Come on, no…',
'Let me go. Let me go!',
'Leave her alone, you bastard!',
'Take him in back, all right? I’ll be right there.',
'Well, go on. This ain’t no peep show.',
'Let’s put him in there!',
'Yeah!',
'That’s for messing up my hair.',
'The hell are you doin’ to my car?',
'Hey, beat it, spook. This don’t concern you.',
'Who you callin’ “spook”, peckerwood?',
'Hey, hey, listen, guys. Look, I don’t want to mess with no reefer addicts, okay?',
'Get home to your mama, boy.',
'Let me out of here! Yo!',
'Lorenzo, where’re your keys?',
'The keys are in the trunk!',
'Say that again?',
'I said the keys are in here!',
'Come on!',
'Hey, you. Get your damn hands off… Oh…',
'I think you got the wrong car, McFly.',
'George, help me! Please!',
'Just turn around, McFly, and walk away.',
'Please, George!',
'Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.',
'No, Biff. You leave her alone.',
'All right, McFly.',
'You’re asking for it. And now you’re gonna get it.',
'Biff, stop it! Biff, you’ll break his arm! Biff, no!',
'Give me a hand here, Reginald.',
'Ow! Damn it, man—I sliced my hand!',
'Whose are these?',
'Mine.',
'Thanks. Thanks a lot.',
'You’re gonna break his arm!',
'Biff! Biff. Leave him alone! Let him go. Let him go. Ow!',
'Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha… Hah hah hah hah hah hah… Heh heh—',
'Are you okay?',
'Who is that guy?',
'That’s George McFly.',
'That’s George McFly?',
'Excuse me…',
'The storm!',
'Hey, guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance!',
'Hey, man. Look at Marvin’s hand. He can’t play with his hand like that, and we can’t play without him.',
'Yeah, well, look, Marvin. Marvin, you gotta play.',
'See, that’s where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor.',
'And if there’s no music, they can’t dance. If they can’t dance, they can’t kiss. If they can’t kiss, they can’t fall in love, and I’m history!',
'Hey, man, the dance is over. Unless you know somebody else that can play the guitar.',
'This is for all you lovers out there.',
'Earth angel, earth angel, will you be mine? 🎵',
'My darling dear, love you all the time. 🎵',
'George, aren’t you going to kiss me?',
'I—I don’t know.',
'I’m just a fool, a fool in love with you. 🎵',
'Scram, McFly. Cuttin’ in.',
'Earth angel, earth angel, the one I adore. 🎵',
'Hey, boy, you all right?',
'I can’t play.',
'Love you forever, and ever more… 🎵',
'George!',
'Ha ha ha…!',
'George…!',
'Ha ha ha, ah…!',
'George…',
'Excuse me.',
'…The vision of your happiness, whoa, whoa-oh! 🎵',
'Earth angel, earth angel, please be mine. 🎵',
'My darling dear, love you for all time. 🎵',
'I’m just a fool, a fool in love… with you. 🎵',
'Yeah, yeah, man. That was good. Let’s do another one!',
'Uh… No, I got to go.',
'Come on, man. Let’s do something that really cooks.',
'Something that… really—really cooks.',
'All right.',
'All right!',
'All right. Uh… All right, this is, uh, this is an oldie, but, uh…',
'Well, it… it’s an oldie where I come from.',
'All right, guys, listen, this is a blues riff in B. Watch me for the changes, and try and keep up, okay?',
'Way down in Lou’siana, down in New Orleans, way back up in the woods among the evergreens. 🎶',
'There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood, where lived a country boy name a Johnny B. Goode. 🎶',
'He never ever learned to read or write so well, he could play the guitar just like he’s ringing a bell. 🎶',
'Go, go! Go, Johnny, go, go! Go, Johnny, go, no, go! Go, Johnny, go, go…! 🎶',
'Hey, George, I heard you laid out Biff. Nice going.',
'George, you ever think of running for class president?!',
'…Johnny B. Goode. 🎶',
'Go, Johnny, go, no! Go, Johnny, go, no, go! Go, Johnny, go, no! Go, Johnny, go, go, go! Johnny B. Goode. 🎶',
'Chuck! Chuck! It’s Marvin!',
'Your cousin, Marvin Berry!',
'You know that new sound you’re looking for?! Well, listen to this!',
'I guess you guys aren’t ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.',
'Lorraine?',
'Marty, that was very interesting music.',
'Uh, yeah.',
'Um, uh, I hope you don’t mind, but George asked if he could take me home.',
'Great! Good. Good, Lorraine. I have a feeling about you two.',
'I have a feeling too.',
'Listen, I gotta go, but, uh, I wanted to tell you that it’s been… educational.',
'Marty, will we ever see you again?',
'I guarantee it.',
'Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice. I’ll never forget it.',
'Right, George.',
'Well, uh, good luck, you guys.',
'Oh… One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he’s eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug… go easy on him.',
'Okay.',
'Marty. Such a nice name.',
'Damn! Where is that kid?',
'Damn!',
'Damn! Damn!',
'You’re late! Do you have no concept of time?!',
'Hey, come on! I had to change! Do you think I’m goin’ back in that—that zoot suit?!',
'The old man really came through—it worked! He laid out Biff in one punch!',
'I didn’t know he had it in him! He’s never stood up to Biff in his life!',
'Never?!',
'No, why?! What’s the matter?!',
'All right! Let’s set your destination time!',
'This is the exact time you left! Let’s send you back… at exactly the same time! It’ll be like you never left.',
'Now I painted a white line on the street way over there! That’s where you’ll start from!',
'I’ve calculated the precise distance, taking into account the acceleration speed and wind resistance retroactive from the moment the lightning strikes, which will be… in exactly… seven minutes and twenty-two seconds!',
'When this alarm goes off, you hit the gas!',
'Right!',
'Well, I guess that’s everything!',
'Thanks.',
'Thank you!',
'See you in about thirty years!',
'I hope so!',
'Don’t worry! As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles an hour, the instant the lightning strikes the tower… everything will be fine.',
'Right.',
'What’s the meaning of this?!',
'You’ll find out in thirty years!',
'It’s about the future, isn’t it?! It’s information about the future!',
'Wait a minute!',
'I warned you about this, kid! The consequences could be disastrous!',
'Doc, that’s a risk you’re going to have to take! Your life depends on it!',
'No!! I refuse to accept the responsibility!',
'In that case, I’ll tell you straight out—!',
'Great Scott!',
'You get the cable! I’ll throw the rope down to you!',
'Right! I got it!',
'Oh-ah-oh!',
'Doc!',
'Come on, come on, let’s go!',
'All right! Take it up!',
'Go!',
'Doc!!',
'Huh?!!',
'I have to tell you about the future!!',
'What?!',
'I have to tell you about the future!!!',
'What?!!',
'On the night!! I go back!! In time!! You get—!!',
'Oh-ah!',
'Doc!',
'Ooh!',
'Go!!',
'No, Doc!!',
'Look at the time!! You’ve got less than four minutes!! Please, hurry!!',
'Yeah!!!',
'Damn it, Doc! Why did you have to tear up that letter?',
'If I only had more time.',
'Wait a minute… I got all the time I want. I got a time machine!',
'I can just go back early and warn him.',
'Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.',
'‘Kay. Time circuit’s on. Flux capacitor… fluxing. Engine running. All right!',
'No. No, no, no, no…',
'Not this time. Come on, come on…',
'Aargh!',
'Come on… Here we go. Here we go. This time. Come on.',
'Please. Please. Come on!',
'Aargh—! Ah!',
'Aargh!!',
'Doc!',
'Yahoo!!! Oh, ha ha!!',
'Crazy drunk driver…',
'Whoo!',
'All right… Oh! Red. You look great. Everything looks great!',
'1:24. I still got time. I’m comin’, Doc.',
'No! No, not again! Come on! Come on…',
'Libyans…',
'No!!! Bastards!',
'Go! …Go!',
'Aargh!!',
'Doc!! Doc!',
'No… No…',
'You’re alive!',
'Bulletproof vest? How did you know?',
'I didn—I never got a chance to tell you.',
'What about all that talk… about screwing up future events? The space-time continuum?',
'Well, I figured… What the hell?',
'So, how far ahead are you goin’?',
'‘Bout thirty years. It’s a nice, round number.',
'Look me up when you get there, all right? Guess I’ll be about… forty-seven.',
'I will.',
'Take care.',
'You too.',
'Right.',
'Bye-bye, Einie.',
'Oh, and watch that re-entry. It’s a little bumpy.',
'You bet.',
'What a nightmare…',
'Oh, if Paul calls me, tell him I’m working at the boutique late tonight.',
'Linda, first of all, I’m not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.',
'Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?',
'I don’t know. I can’t keep up with all of your boyfriends.',
'Hey. What the hell is this?',
'Breakfast.',
'What, d’ya sleep in your clothes again last night?',
'Yeah, I… Yeah, what—what’re you wearin’, Dave?',
'Marty. I always wear a suit to the office.',
'You all right?',
'Yeah.',
'I think we need a rematch, George.',
'Oh, oh, a rematch? Why, were you cheating?',
'No!',
'Hello.',
'Good morning.',
'Mom! Dad!',
'Did you hit your head?',
'Marty, are you all right?',
'You guys… You guys look great! Mom, you—you look so thin!',
'Why, thank you, Marty.',
'George!',
'Good morning, sleepyhead.',
'Good morning, Dave.',
'Good morning, Mom.',
'Linda.',
'Hey, Mom.',
'Oh, Marty, I almost forgot. Jennifer Parker called.',
'I sure like her, Marty. She is such a sweet girl.',
'Isn’t tonight the night of the big date?',
'What? What, Ma?',
'Aren’t you going up to the lake tonight? You’ve been planning it for two weeks.',
'Well, uh, Mom, we talked about this. We’re not gonna go to the lake. The car’s wrecked.',
'Wrecked?!',
'Wrecked?! When the hell did this happen?! And why wasn’t I told?!',
'Quiet down. I’m sure the car is fine.',
'Why am I always the last one to know about these things?!',
'Marty, what happened to it?!',
'See? There’s Biff out there waxing her right now.',
'Uh, now, Biff, I want to make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.',
'I’m just finishing up the second coat now.',
'Now, Biff. Don’t con me.',
'I’m—I’m sorry, Mister McFly. I meant I was just starting on the second coat.',
'Ah, Biff. What a character. Always trying to get away with something.',
'I’ve had to stay on top of Biff ever since high school.',
'Although, if it wasn’t for him…',
'We never would have fallen in love.',
'That’s right.',
'Mister McFly! Mister McFly, this just arrived! (Oh! Hi, Marty.) I think it’s your new book!',
'Oh, honey. Your first novel!',
'Like I’ve always told you, you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything!',
'Oh, Marty! Marty, here’s your keys! You’re all waxed up, ready for tonight!',
'Keys?',
'How ‘bout a ride, mister?',
'Jennifer. Oh, are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.',
'Marty, you’re acting like you haven’t seen me in a week!',
'I haven’t.',
'You okay? Is everything all right?',
'Oh, yeah. Everything is great.',
'Marty! You’ve gotta come back with me!',
'Where?',
'Back to the future!',
'Wait a minute. What are you doin’, Doc?',
'I need fuel.',
'Go ahead. Quick. Get in the car.',
'No, no, no, no. Doc, I just got here, okay? Jennifer’s here. We’re gonna take the new truck for a spin.',
'Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.',
'Wait a minute, Doc. Wh—what are you talking about? What happens to us in the future?',
'What, do we become assholes or something?',
'No, no, no, no, no, Marty. Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.',
'It’s your kids, Marty! Something has got to be done about your kids!',
'Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don’t have enough road to get up to 88.',
'Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need… roads.',
'TO BE CONTINUED…',
'Say, Marty! M—Marty! Marty, I wanna—wanted to show you these new matchbooks for my auto detailing I had printed up!',
'A flying DeLorean?',
'What the hell is going on here?',
'BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II',
'Screenplay by BOB GALE\nStory by ROBERT ZEMECKIS & BOB GALE',
'Aaah!',
'What the hell was that?!',
'Taxicab.',
'What do you mean a taxicab? I thought we were flying.',
'Precisely.',
'All right, Doc. What’s going on, huh? Where are we? When are we?!',
'We’re descending toward Hill Valley, California, at 4:29 PM, on Wednesday, October 21, 2015.',
'2015?! You mean we’re in the future?!',
'Future?! Marty, what do you mean?! How can we be in the future?!',
'Uh, Jennifer, um… I don’t know how to tell you this, but… you’re in a time machine.',
'And this is the year 2015?!',
'October 21, 2015.',
'God! So, like, you weren’t kidding.',
'Marty, we can actually see our future!',
'Doc! Now you said we were married, right?',
'Y—! Uh…',
'Yeah… Was it a big wedding?',
'Marty, we’re gonna be able to see our wedding!',
'Wow…',
'I’m gonna be able to see my wedding dress!',
'Wow.',
'God, I wonder where we live. I bet it’s a big house with lots of kids, and—how many kids—',
'Doc! What the hell are you doing?!',
'Relax, Marty. It’s just a sleep-inducing alpha-rhythm generator.',
'She was asking too many questions, and no one should know too much about their future.',
'This way when she wakes up, she’ll think it was all a dream.',
'Then what did you bring her for?!',
'I had to do something!',
'She saw the time machine! I couldn’t just leave her there with that information!',
'Don’t worry. She’s not essential to my plan.',
'Well, you’re the doc, Doc.',
'Here’s our exit!',
'First, you’ve gotta get out and change clothes.',
'What, right now?! It’s pouring rain!',
'Wait five more seconds.',
'Right on the tick.',
'Amazing. Absolutely amazing.',
'Too bad the post office isn’t as efficient as the weather service.',
'Excuse the disguise, Marty, but I was afraid you wouldn’t recognize me.',
'I went to a rejuvenation clinic and got an all-natural overhaul.',
'They took out some wrinkles, did a hair repair, changed the blood, added a good thirty or forty years to my life.',
'They also replaced my spleen and colon.',
'What do you think?',
'You look great, Doc.',
'The future… Unbelievable.',
'I gotta check this out, Doc.',
'All in good time, Marty. We’re on a tight schedule here.',
'Tell me about my future. I mean, I know I make it big. But what, do I become, like, a rich rock star…?',
'Please, Marty, no one should know too much about their own destiny.',
'Right. Right…',
'I am rich, though, right?',
'Marty, please, take off your shirt.',
'Put on the jacket and the shoes.',
'Got a mission to accomplish!',
'Huh. Precisely on schedule.',
'Power laces! All right!',
'This thing doesn’t fit.',
'Size adjusting. Fit.',
'Pull out your pants pockets. All kids in the future wear their pants inside out.',
'Put on this cap.',
'Perfect. You’re the spitting image of your future son.',
'What?!',
'Help me move Jennifer over here!',
'So what’s the deal?',
'Grab her feet.',
'Okay, now what?',
'In exactly two minutes, you go around the corner into the Cafe 80’s.',
'Cafe 80’s?',
'One of those nostalgia places, but not done very well.',
'Go in and order a Pepsi. Here’s a fifty.',
'Then wait for a guy named Griff.',
'Right. Griff.',
'Right. Griff’s going to ask you about tonight. Are you in or out?',
'Tell him you are out! Whatever he says, whatever happens, say no, you’re not interested!',
'Okay.',
'Then leave, come back here, and wait for me!',
'Don’t talk to anyone, don’t touch anything, don’t do anything, don’t interact with anyone, and try not to look at anything!',
'I don’t get it. I—I thought you said this had something to do with my kids?',
'Look what happens to your son!',
'My son?',
'God, he looks just like me.',
'“Within two hours of his arrest, Martin McFly Junior was tried, convicted, and sentenced to fifteen years in a state penitentiary”?! Within two hours?',
'The justice system works swiftly in the future, now that they’ve abolished all lawyers!',
'Oh, this is heavy.',
'It gets worse. Next week, your daughter attempts to break him out of jail, and she gets sent up for twenty years!',
'Wh—My daughter?! Wait a minute—I have a daughter?!',
'You see? This one event starts a chain reaction that completely destroys your entire family!',
'Hey, Doc, this date… This is tomorrow’s newspaper!',
'Precisely. I already went further ahead into time to see what else happens.',
'I backtracked everything to this one event. That’s why we’re here today, to prevent this incident from ever happening.',
'Damn! I’m late!',
'Wait a minute! Where you going now?!',
'To intercept the real Marty Junior! You’re taking his place! Around the corner at the Cafe 80’s! Guy named Griff! Just say no!',
'Hey! What—what about Jennifer? We’re not just gonna leave her here.',
'Don’t worry, she’ll be safe. It’ll just be for a few minutes.',
'Oh, Marty. Be careful around that Griff character. He’s got a few short circuits in his bionic implants.',
'The future.',
'Welcome to Texaco.',
'You can trust your car to the system with the star.',
'Checking oil. Checking landing gear.',
'Aargh!!',
'The shark still looks fake.',
'Hi, friends. Goldie Wilson III for Wilson Hover Conversion Systems.',
'You know, when my grandpa was mayor of Hill Valley, he had to worry about traffic problems.',
'But now! You don’t have to worry about traffic!',
'I’ll hover-convert your old road car into a skyway flier. For only $39,999.95.',
'So come on down and see me, Goldie Wilson III, at any one of our twenty-nine convenient locations.',
'Remember: Keep ‘em flying.',
'It’s got, uh, hot salsa, avocados, cilantro mixed with your choice of beans, chicken, bee—bee—beef, or pork.',
'Waiter? Waiter?',
'Welcome to the Cafe 80’s, where it’s always morning in America, even in the aftern—n—noon. Heh heh heh heh.',
'Our special today is mesquite-grilled sushi.',
'Yes! You must have the hostage special!',
'Cajun style.',
'Yes! You must have the hostage special! Yes! You must have the hostage special!',
'Hey, hey, hey! Hey, guys! Hey, hey, hey! Guys!',
'All I want is a Pepsi.',
'Hey, McFly!',
'Yeah. I seen you around. You’re Marty McFly’s kid, aren’t you?',
'Biff?!',
'You’re Marty Junior.',
'Tough break, kid. Must be rough being named after a complete butthead.',
'What’s that supposed to mean?!',
'Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Huh?',
'Hey! Hey!',
'Think, McFly, think!',
'Your old man? Mister Loser?',
'What?!',
'That’s right. Loser with a capital “L”.',
'Look, I happen to know George McFly is no longer a loser—',
'No, I’m not talking about George McFly. I’m talking about his kid!',
'Your old man, Marty McFly Senior. The man who took his life and flushed it completely down the toilet.',
'I did?',
'I—I mean—I mean, he did?',
'Hey, Gramps! I told you two coats of wax on my car, not just one!',
'Hey, hey, I just put the second coat on last week.',
'Yeah?! With your eyes closed?!',
'Are you two related?',
'Hello? Hello? Anybody home?',
'What do you think, Griff just calls me “Grandpa” for his health?',
'He’s Griff?',
'Gramps! What the hell am I paying you for?!',
'Hey, kid. Say hello to your grandma for me.',
'Get out here, Gramps!',
'Hey, take it easy!',
'And McFly! Don’t go anywhere! You’re next!',
'This is a video game!',
'I got it working!',
'My dad taught me about these.',
'It is “Wild Gunman”.',
'How do you play this thing?',
'I’ll show you, kid.',
'I’m a crack shot at this.',
'You mean you have to use your hands?!',
'That’s like a baby’s toy!',
'Baby’s toy…?',
'Pepsi Perfect.',
'Damn!',
'Pepsi.',
'Hey, McFly!',
'I thought I told you to stay in here!',
'Griff. Guys. How’s it going?',
'McFly!',
'Yeah?',
'McFly!!',
'What?',
'Your shoe’s unvelked!',
'So, McFly. Have you made a decision about tonight’s opportunity?',
'Um, yeah, Griff. You know, I was thinking about it. I’m not sure, because I just think, you know, it might be a little bit dangerous, so…',
'What’s wrong, McFly?',
'You got no scrote?',
'Ah-ooo!',
'He’s a complete wimp.',
'What’s it gonna be, McFly?! Are you in or out?!',
'Um… I just… I’m—I’m not sure that I should. You know, because I think that I should discuss it with my father.',
'Your father?!',
'Wrong answer, McFly!',
'Okay, Griff. I’ll do it. I’ll do it, buddy. Whatever you say.',
'Stay down and shut up!',
'Keep pedaling, you two!',
'Now. Let’s hear the right answer!',
'Well! Since when did you become the physical type?!',
'The answer’s no, Griff.',
'No?',
'Yeah. What are you, deaf and stupid? I said no!',
'What’s wrong, McFly?! Chicken?!',
'What did you call me, Griff?',
'Chicken, McFly!',
'Nobody… calls me… ah… chicken.',
'All right, punk!',
'Hey, look!',
'Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey! Stop!',
'Little girl, little girl! Stop.',
'Hey!',
'Look. I need to borrow your… hoverboard?',
'Where is he?!',
'Here.',
'There!',
'He’s on a hoverboard!',
'Get the boards!',
'Get McFly!',
'Aaah!',
'Get him!',
'Yeah!',
'Yeah, we got him!',
'There’s something very familiar about all this.',
'Uh! Aargh!',
'Hey, McFly, you bojo! Those boards don’t work on water!',
'Unless you’ve got power!',
'Ah, ha ha ha ha ha!',
'Hook on!',
'Batter up!',
'Holy shit!',
'Buttheads.',
'Drying mode on!',
'Jacket drying.',
'Your jacket is now dry.',
'Hey, kid. Hey, little girl. Thanks.',
'Keep it. I got a Pit Bull now.',
'Come on. Let’s go.',
'Save the clock tower!',
'Hey, kid. Thumb a hundred bucks, will you, and help save the clock tower.',
'I… Sorry, no.',
'Come on, kid. That’s an important historical landmark!',
'Look, some other time.',
'Lightning struck that thing sixty years ago.',
'Wait a minute. Cubs win World Series. …Against Miami?',
'Yeah, it’s something, huh? Who would’ve thought? Hundred-to-one shot!',
'I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season, put some money on the Cubs.',
'I just meant that Miami… What did you just say?',
'I said I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season. Put some money on the Cubbies!',
'Now this has an interesting feature. It has a dust jacket. Books used to have these to protect the covers.',
'Of course, that was before they had dust-repellent paper.',
'And if you’re interested in dust, we have a quaint little piece from the 1980s. It’s called a DustBuster.',
'Marty!',
'I can’t lose!',
'Marty! Up here!',
'Hey, Doc, what’s going on?',
'Stand by. I’ll park over there.',
'Yeah, all right.',
'Hey, right on time.',
'Flying DeLorean! Heh. I haven’t seen one of those in… thirty years.',
'Sorry. Excuse me, sorry.',
'Hey, I’m walking here! I’m walking here!',
'What the hell?',
'Don’t drive tranked! Low-res, scuzzball congro!',
'Two of them?',
'I left him in a suspended animation kennel. Einstein never knew I was gone!',
'Marty! What in the name of Sir Isaac H. Newton happened here?',
'Oh, yeah, Doc! Listen, my kid showed up. All hell broke loose.',
'Your kid?! Great Scott, the sleep inducer. I was afraid of this.',
'Because I used it on Jennifer, there wasn’t enough power left to knock your son out for a full hour. Damn!',
'Doc, Doc, Doc, look at this! It’s changing.',
'I was framed!',
'Why, yes! Yes, of course!',
'Because this hoverboard incident has now occurred, Griff now goes to jail!',
'Therefore, your son won’t go with him tonight, and that robbery will never take place!',
'Thus, history—future history—has now been altered, and this is the proof!',
'Marty, we’ve succeeded, not exactly as I planned, but no matter. Let’s go get Jennifer and go home!',
'Hi, Einie. Hi, buddy.',
'What’s this?',
'Uh, it’s—a—souvenir—book.',
'“Fifty years of sports statistics”. Hardly recreational reading material, Marty.',
'Well, hey, Doc! What’s the harm in bringing back a little info on the future? You know, maybe we could place a couple bets.',
'Marty! I didn’t invent the time machine for financial gain!',
'The intent here is to gain a clearer perception of humanity.',
'Where we’ve been, where we’re going! The pitfalls and the possibilities! The perils and the promise.',
'Perhaps even an answer to that universal question, “Why?”',
'Hey, Doc! I’m all for that. What’s wrong with making a few bucks on the side?',
'I am going to put this in the trash!',
'Great Scott!!',
'McFly, Jennifer Jane Parker. 3793 Oakhurst Street, Hilldale. Age forty-seven.',
'Forty-seven?! That’s a hell of a good facelift.',
'What the hell are they doing, Doc?!',
'They used her thumbprint to assess her ID.',
'Since her thumbprint never changes over the years, they simply assume she’s the Jennifer of the future.',
'Well, we gotta stop ‘em!',
'What are we gonna say? That we’re time travelers? They’d have us committed.',
'She’s clean. That means we take her home.',
'Home? To Hilldale?',
'It’ll be dark by the time we get out there.',
'That’s it! They’re taking her home, to your future home!',
'We’ll arrive shortly thereafter, get her out of there, and go back to 1985.',
'You mean I’m gonna see where I live?! I’m gonna see myself as an old man?!',
'No, no, no, Marty. That could result in a—oh! Great Scott!',
'Jennifer could conceivably encounter her future self!',
'The consequences of that could be disastrous!',
'Doc, what do you mean?',
'I foresee two possibilities.',
'One: Coming face to face with herself thirty years older would put her into shock, and she’d simply pass out.',
'Or Two: The encounter could create a time paradox, the results of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe!',
'Granted, that’s a worst-case scenario. The destruction might in fact be very localized, limited to merely our own galaxy.',
'Well, that’s a relief.',
'Let’s go. I sure hope we find Jennifer before she finds herself.',
'The skyway’s jammed. It’s gonna take us forever to get there.',
'And this stays here. I didn’t invent the time machine to win at gambling. I invented the time machine to travel through time.',
'I know. I know. I know, Doc.',
'So, Doc Brown invented a time machine.',
'Hilldale. Nothing but a breeding ground for tranks, lo-bos, and zipheads.',
'Yeah, they oughta tear this whole place down.',
'Welcome home, Jennifer.',
'You all right?',
'You got a little tranked, but I think you can walk.',
'Ma’am, you should reprogram. It’s dangerous to enter without lights on.',
'Lights on?',
'Yes. Now look. Just… take it easy, and you’ll be fine. And be careful in the future.',
'The future?',
'Have a nice day, Missus McFly.',
'Broadcasting beautiful views twenty-four hours a day. You’re tuned to the Scenery Channel.',
'I’m in the future.',
'I get married in the Chapel O’ Love?!',
'Mom? Mom, is that you?',
'I gotta get out of here!',
'Mom? Mom? Mom, is that you?',
'Grandma Lorraine!',
'Sweetheart!',
'Hi!',
'What happened to Grandpa?',
'Oh, he threw his back out again.',
'How’s Granddad’s little pumpkin?',
'How did you do that? How did he do that?',
'Oh, out on the golf course.',
'Are your folks home yet? I brought pizza for everyone.',
'Oh, who’s going to eat all that?',
'Oh, I will.',
'Damn this traffic!',
'Jennifer—that is, Old Jennifer—usually gets home around now. I hope we’re not too late.',
'What is it? What’s the matter, Doc?',
'For a moment, I thought I saw a taxi in my rear display. I thought it was following us. Weird.',
'I can’t believe this window’s still broken.',
'Well, when the scene-screen repairman called Daddy a chicken, Daddy threw him out of the house. Now we can’t get anybody to fix it.',
'Oh, look how worn out this is.',
'Your father’s biggest problem, Marlene, is that he loses all self-control when someone calls him chicken.',
'How many times have we heard it, George?',
'“Mom, I can’t let ‘em think I’m chicken.”',
'You’re right! Well, you’re right!',
'About thirty years ago, your father tried to prove he wasn’t chicken, and he ended up in an automobile accident.',
'Oh, you mean with the Rolls-Royce?',
'Mmm-hmm.',
'Automobile accident.',
'All right, Einie. Let’s find Jennifer.',
'I don’t believe it. I live in Hilldale? This is great! Way to go, McFly!',
'Marty, stay here. Change clothes. If I need you, I’ll holler.',
'Come on, Doc, I wanna check out my house.',
'We can’t risk you running into your older self.',
'Come on, Einie, let’s go. Where’s Jennifer, huh? Where’s Jennifer?',
'Hilldale. This is bitchin’.',
'One. Seven. Four. Point. Five. Zero.',
'That’ll be one-seventy-four-fifty.',
'Here.',
'I’d be careful, old timer. This is a rough neighborhood.',
'Where’s my receipt?',
'Right here. Here it is.',
'Hello. Hello. How about a tip?',
'That accident caused a chain reaction that sent Marty’s life straight down the tubes.',
'If not for that accident, your father’s life would have turned out very differently.',
'The man in the Rolls-Royce wouldn’t have pressed charges, Marty wouldn’t have broken his hand, and he wouldn’t have given up on his music. And he wouldn’t have spent all those years feeling sorry for himself.',
'Hey, Mom, nice pants.',
'I think the real reason your mother married him was because she felt sorry for him.',
'“Mom”?',
'Such a sweet girl.',
'Art off.',
'I think maybe she deserves…',
'Okay, I want channels 18, 24, 63, 109, 87, and the Weather Channel.',
'Tonight… The Weather Channel, bringing you the world’s weather twenty-four hours a day… Give me big… And weather conditions remain the same… All board-certified implant surgeons… With a minor warm front…',
'Welcome home, Marty.',
'Hey, hey, hey! Dad’s home! That’s right! He’s home! Dad’s home!',
'Lord of the manor.',
'Hello, hello!',
'King of the castle.',
'Hello? What the hell is this?',
'Lithium mode on.',
'Ah, that’s better. Damn kids.',
'Hey, Son. Watchin’ a little TV for a change?',
'Son of a…',
'Hey, pizza! I’m hungry!',
'Oh, all right. Just wait your turn.',
'Grandma, when it’s ready, could you just shove it in my mouth? Ah, ha ha!',
'Don’t you be a smart-ass!',
'Oh, great—the Atrocity Channel.',
'Hydrate level 4, please.',
'Mmm.',
'Is it ready?!',
'Here you go.',
'Oh, boy, oh, boy, Mom. You sure can hydrate a pizza.',
'…Now I’m sorry. I missed that whole thing.',
'Well, I’m just worried about Jennifer. Why isn’t she home yet?',
'I’m not sure where Jennifer is, Mom. Should’ve been home hours ago, but I’m havin’ a hard time keepin’ track of her these days.',
'Hey, fruit. Fruit, please!',
'She’s in one of those moods, I guess. I don’t know.',
'Thank you.',
'Aren’t you and Jennifer getting along?',
'Oh, yeah. Great, Mom. Um, we’re like a couple of teenagers, you know.',
'Dad. Telephone. It’s Needles.',
'Dad, it’s for you.',
'All right. Well, I’ll… take that in the den. Excuse me.',
'Retract!',
'Hello. I’m in here, please.',
'Hey, hey… The big M. How’s it hanging, McFly?',
'Hey, Needles.',
'Needles?',
'So, did you take look at that little business proposal of mine?',
'I don’t know, Needles.',
'What are you afraid of? If this thing works, it’ll solve all your financial problems.',
'And if it doesn’t work, Needles, I could get fired. It’s illegal. I mean—what if the Jits is monitoring, huh?',
'The Jits will never find out.',
'Oh, God.',
'Come on. Stick your card in the slot, and I’ll handle it.',
'Unless you want everyone in the division to think you’re… chicken.',
'Nobody… calls me chicken, Needles. Nobody!',
'All right. Prove it.',
'All right. All right, Needles.',
'Hah. Here’s my card. Scan it. I’m in.',
'Thanks, McFly. I’ll see you at the plant tomorrow.',
'Thank you for using AT&T.',
'Huh. Chicken.',
'McFly!!',
'Fujitsu-san! Konnichi wa!',
'McFly! I was monitoring that scan you just interfaced. You are terminated!',
'Terminated?! No! No! It wasn’t my fault, sir! It was Needles! Needles was behind the whole thing!',
'And you cooperated. It was illegal. And you knew!',
'No, I didn’t! Uh—It was a sting operation! I was—I was setting him up!',
'McFly, read my fax!',
'No! Please! No, I cannot be fired! I’m fired! Aaah!',
'Aw, this is heavy. Aw, what am I going to tell Jennifer?',
'Jennifer! Jennifer!',
'Oh, Doc! Am I glad to see you!',
'Go out the front door. I’ll meet you there.',
'But it doesn’t open. There’s no doorknob.',
'Press your thumb to the plate.',
'What plate?',
'Marty! What does this fax mean?',
'Oh, Mom, it’s a joke, an office joke, kind of a joke fax.',
'A joke?! Oh, Marty! I heard you yelling.',
'No, Mom, Mom. Mom! Calm down. I wasn’t yelling. Needles and I were just kind of joking.',
'Welcome home, Jennifer.',
'Marty, have you lost your job?',
'Lost my job, Mom? Get out of town. Look…',
'Oh! I’m young!\nOh! I’m old!',
'Marty! Marty! Marty! Come! Quick, quick!',
'Ow! Oh! Ah… Oh…',
'She encountered her older self and went into shock! Just as I predicted! She’ll be fine.',
'Let’s get her back to 1985. And then I’m gonna destroy the time machine!',
'Destroy it? What about all that stuff about humanity? Where we’re goin’ and why?',
'The risks are just too great, as this incident proves.',
'And I was behaving responsibly! Just imagine the danger if the time machine were to fall into the wrong hands!',
'Ah! Oh… Uh…',
'My only regret is that I’ll never get a chance to visit my favorite historical era, the Old West.',
'But time traveling is just too dangerous. Better that I devote myself to studying the other great mystery of the universe… women.',
'Marty, Einie, brace yourselves for temporal displacement.',
'Did we make it?',
'Are we back?',
'Aaah!!',
'We’re back.',
'Let’s put her in the swing! Then I’ll take you home, and you can come back in your truck and wake her.',
'When she awakens here in her own house, and it’s dark, you should be able to convince her that it was all a dream.',
'Wait a minute. We’re just gonna leave her here on the porch?',
'The disorientation will help convince her that it was all a dream.',
'How long do you think she’s gonna be out?',
'I’m not quite sure. She received quite a shock.',
'Could be for a few minutes. Most probably a couple of hours.',
'You better bring smelling salts back with you.',
'You’re the doc, Doc.',
'All right. Come on. Let’s go, Einie.',
'Don’t worry. She’ll be fine.',
'I don’t remember bars being on these windows.',
'If you need me, I’ll be back at my lab dismantling this thing.',
'Right.',
'What the hell?',
'Aaah!! Aaah!! Aaah!!',
'Ah! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait! Wait a minute! What—What—What—What are you doing in my room?! Wait a minute!',
'Help! Rape! Help! Rape! Mom!',
'Okay… Okay…',
'Dad, help!',
'Freeze, sucker!',
'Hey! It’s okay! I don’t want any trouble!',
'He jumped me! He came through the window!',
'Well, you got trouble now, you piece of trash!',
'What are you doing in here with my daughter?!',
'Hey, listen! I’m just in the wrong house!',
'You got that right, you little son of a…!',
'Hey, look! I made a mistake!',
'Damn right you made a mistake!',
'Aaah!',
'Kill him! Kill him!',
'I’m gonna tear your ass up!',
'That’s right, you keep running, sucker! And you tell that realty company that I ain’ selling, you hear?! We ain’t gonna be terrorized!',
'This has gotta be the wrong year.',
'1985? It can’t be.',
'Drop it!',
'So you’re the son of a bitch who’s been stealing my newspapers.',
'Mister Strickland! Mister Strickland. It’s—It’s me, sir. It’s Marty.',
'Who?!',
'It’s Marty McFly! Marty McFly! Don’t you know me, sir, from school, sir?!',
'I’ve never seen you before in my life, but you look to me like a slacker!',
'Yeah, that’s right! That’s right, I am a slacker!',
'Don’t you remember, you gave me detention last week?!',
'Last week? The school burned down six years ago!',
'Now you got exactly three seconds to get off my porch with your nuts intact. One…',
'Oh, please, Mister Strickland! I just want to know what the hell’s going on here!',
'Two…!',
'Aaah!',
'Hey, Strickland!',
'Yeah!',
'Eat lead, slackers!',
'Ah! Ah! Oh! Uh!',
'Watch where you’re going… crazy drunk pedestrian!',
'Red!',
'Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Biff Tannen Museum. Dedicated to Hill Valley’s number-one citizen and America’s greatest living folk hero: the one and only… Biff Tannen.',
'Of course, we’ve all heard the legend, but who is the man? Inside, you will learn how Biff Tannen became one of the richest and most powerful men in America.',
'Learn the amazing history of the Tannen family, starting with his great-grandfather, Buford “Mad Dog” Tannen, fastest gun in the West.',
'See Biff’s humble beginnings and how a trip to the racetrack on his twenty-first birthday made him a millionaire overnight.',
'Share in the excitement of a fabulous winning streak that earned him the nickname “The Luckiest Man on Earth.”',
'Learn how Biff parlayed that lucky winning streak into the vast empire called Biffco.',

'Meet the women who shared in his passion as he searched for true love.',
'And relive Biff’s happiest moment as, in 1973, he realized his lifelong romantic dream by marrying his high school sweetheart, Lorraine Baines McFly.',
'How’s it feel, Mister Tannen?',
'Third time’s the charm.',
'No!! No! No!',
'Hey! Hey! You’re coming with us upstairs!',
'Let me go!',
'Sonny, we can do this the easy way or the hard way!',
'The easy way…',
'Mom? Mom, is that you?',
'Just relax, Marty. You’ve been asleep for almost two hours.',
'I had a horrible nightmare. It was terrible.',
'Well, you’re safe and sound now, back on the good-old twenty-seventh floor.',
'Twenty-seventh floor!',
'Ah! Ah! Ah!',
'Mom? Mom, that can’t be you.',
'Well, yes, it’s me, Marty. Are you all right?',
'I’m fine. I’m fine. It’s just that you’re so… you’re so… big.',
'Oh. Everything’s gonna be fine, Marty. Are—are you hungry? I—I can call room service.',
'Room service?',
'Lorraine!!',
'Oh, my God, it’s your father.',
'My father?',
'You’re supposed to be in Switzerland, you little son of a bitch!',
'My father?!',
'Did you get kicked out of another boarding school?!',
'Damn it, Lorraine. Do you know how much perfectly good dough I’ve blown on this no-good kid of yours, huh?! On all three of them?!',
'What the hell do you care?! We can afford it! The least we can do with all that money is provide a better life for our children!',
'Hold—Hold on one second! Let’s get this straight! Marty is your kid, not mine! And all the money in the world wouldn’t do jack shit for that lazy bum!',
'Stop it, Biff! Just stop it!',
'Look at him. He’s a butthead, just like his old man was.',
'Don’t you dare speak that way about George! You’re not even half the man he was!',
'You son of a bitch!',
'Hey! Hey!',
'Always the little hothead, huh?',
'You wanna take a poke at me?',
'Ooh!',
'Damn it, Biff! That’s it, I’m leaving!',
'Oh, ho ho. So go ahead.',
'But think about this, Lorraine: Who’s gonna pay for all your clothes, huh? And your jewelry and your liquor? Who’s gonna pay for your cosmetic surgery, Lorraine?',
'You were the one who wanted me to get these—these… things! If you want ‘em back, you can have them.',
'Look, Lorraine. You walk out that door, and I won’t only cut off you! I’ll cut off your kids!',
'You wouldn’t!',
'Oh, wouldn’t I?',
'First your daughter, Linda. I’ll cancel all her credit cards. She can settle her debts with the bank all by herself.',
'Your idiot son, Dave? I’ll get his probation revoked.',
'And as for Marty… Well, maybe you’d like to have all three of your kids behind bars, just like your brother Joey. One big, happy, jailbird family.',
'All right, Biff. You win. I’ll stay.',
'As for you, I’ll be back up here in an hour, so you better not be!',
'He was right, and I was wrong.',
'Mom! Mom, what are you saying—you’re actually defending him!',
'I had it coming. He’s my husband, and he takes care of all of us, and he deserves our respect.',
'Respect?! Your husband?! How could he be your husband?! How could you leave Dad for him?!',
'Leave Dad? Marty, are you feeling all right?',
'No! No, I’m not feeling all right! I don’t understand one damn thing that’s going on around here, and why nobody can give me a simple, straight answer!',
'Oh, they must have hit you over the head hard this time.',
'Mom, I just want to know one thing. Where’s my father?! Where’s George McFly?!',
'Marty… George—your father—is in the same place he’s been for the past twelve years: Oak Park Cemetery.',
'No… No… This can’t be happening! “March 15, 1973”? No! Oh, please, God, no! No, please, God. Please, God. No, this can’t be happening! This can’t be…!',
'I’m afraid it is happening, Marty. All of it.',
'Doc?!',
'When I learned about your father, I figured you’d come here.',
'Then you know what happened to him? You know what happened…? March 15, 1973?',
'Yes, Marty, I know.',
'I went to the public library to try to make sense out of all the madness. The place was boarded up, shut down, so I broke in and borrowed some newspapers.',
'I don’t get it, Doc. I mean, how can all this be happening? It’s like we’re in hell or something.',
'No, it’s Hill Valley. Although I can’t imagine hell being much worse!',
'Oh, Einie… I’m sorry, boy. The lab is an awful, awful, awful, awful mess!',
'Attaboy.',
'Obviously the time continuum has been disrupted, creating this new, temporal-event sequence, resulting in this alternate reality.',
'English, Doc!',
'Here, here, here! Let me illustrate…',
'Imagine that this line represents time. Here’s the present, 1985, the future, and the past…',
'Prior to this point in time, somewhere in the past, the timeline skewed into this tangent, creating an alternate 1985. Alternate to you, me, and Einstein, but reality for everyone else.',
'Recognize this? It’s the bag the sports book came in. I know, because the receipt was still inside. I found them in the time machine, along with this!',
'It’s the top of Biff’s cane. I mean Old Biff, from the future.',
'Correct. It was in the time machine because Biff was in the time machine… with the sports almanac!',
'Holy shit.',
'You see, while we were in the future, Biff got the sports book, stole the time machine, went back in time, and gave the book to himself at some point in the past.',
'Look. It says right here that Biff made his first million betting on a horse race in 1958.',
'He wasn’t just lucky. He knew because he had all the race results in the sports almanac. That’s how he made his entire fortune!',
'Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass.',
'The almanac… Son of a bitch stole my idea! He must have been listening when I—',
'It’s my fault. The whole thing is my fault. If I hadn’t bought that damn book, none of this would have ever happened.',
'Well, it’s all in the past.',
'You mean the future?',
'Whatever! It demonstrates precisely how time travel can be misused and why the time machine must be destroyed… after we straighten all of this out.',
'Right, so we go back to the future, and we stop Biff from stealing the time machine.',
'We can’t, because if we travel into the future from this point in time, it will be the future of this reality—in which Biff is corrupt and powerful and married to your mother, and in which this has happened to me!',
'No. Our only chance to repair the present is in the past, at the point where the timeline skewed into this tangent!',
'In order to put the universe back as we remember it and get back to our reality, we have to find out the exact date and the specific circumstances of how, where, and when Young Biff got his hands on that sports almanac.',
'I’ll ask him.',
'Bulletproof vest! Ah, ha! Great flick! Great frigging flick! The guy is brilliant!',
'Hey, what the hell’s goin’…',
'Aaah!',
'Hey! What the hell are you doing in here?!',
'Party’s over, Biff. Sorry, ladies.',
'How’d you get past my security downstairs?',
'There’s a little matter we need to talk about.',
'Yeah, money, right?! Well, forget it!',
'No. Not money. “Gray’s… Sports… Almanac”.',
'You heard him, girls. Party’s over.',
'Start talking, kid. What else you know about that book?',
'First, you tell me how you got it. How, where, and when.',
'Hah. All right. Take a seat.',
'Sit down!',
'November 12, 1955. That was when.',
'November 12, 1955?! That was the date I went back—that… was the date of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm.',
'You know your history. Very good.',
'I’ll never forget that Saturday. I’d just picked my car up from the shop, ‘cause I’d rolled it in a drag race a few days earlier.',
'I thought you crashed into a manure truck.',
'How do you know about that?',
'My father told me about it.',
'Your father?',
'Before he died.',
'Oh, yeah, right.',
'So there I was, minding my own business. This crazy old codger with a cane shows up. He says he’s my distant relative. I don’t see any resemblance.',
'So he says, “How would you like to be rich?” So I said, “Sure.”',
'So he lays this book on me. He says this book will tell me the outcome of every sporting event till the end of the century. All I have to do is bet on the winner, and I’ll never lose.',
'So I said, “What’s the catch?” He says, “No catch. Just keep it a secret.”',
'After that, he disappeared. I never saw him again.',
'Oh, and he told me one more thing. He said, “Someday a crazy, wild-eyed scientist or a kid may show up askin’ about that book. And if that ever happens…”',
'Heh. Funny. I never thought it would be you.',
'Yeah, well, Biff, you’re forgetting one thing. What the hell is that?!',
'Oh—You’re dead, you little son of a bitch!',
'Hey, there he is!',
'Hey, hey, kid!',
'Go ahead, kid! Jump! A suicide will be nice and neat.',
'What if I don’t?!',
'Lead poisoning.',
'What about the police, Biff?! They’re gonna match up the bullet with that gun!',
'Kid, I own the police!',
'Besides, they couldn’t match up the bullet that killed your old man!',
'You son of a—',
'I suppose it’s poetic justice. Two McFlys with the same gun!',
'Huh. Idiot.',
'What the hell?! Ooh!',
'Nice shot, Doc!',
'You’re not gonna believe this! We gotta go back to 1955!',
'I don’t believe it!',
'That’s right, Doc. November 12, 1955.',
'Unbelievable that Old Biff could’ve chosen that particular date.',
'It could mean that that point in time inherently contains some sort of cosmic significance, almost as if it were the temporal junction point for the entire space-time continuum!',
'On the other hand, it could just be an amazing coincidence.',
'Damn! Got to fix that thing.',
'All right. Time circuits on.',
'What do you mean, time circuits on? Doc… We’re not going back now?!',
'Yep.',
'Doc, what about Jennifer?! What about Einstein?! We can’t just leave them here!',
'Don’t worry, Marty. Assuming we succeed in our mission, this alternate 1985 will be changed back into the real 1985, instantaneously transforming around Jennifer and Einie.',
'Jennifer and Einie will be fine, and they will have absolutely no memory of this horrible place.',
'Doc… What if we don’t succeed?',
'We must succeed.',
'Aw, this is heavy, Doc. I mean, it’s like I was just here yesterday.',
'You were here yesterday, Marty, you were! Amazing, isn’t it?',
'All right. Sunrise should be in about twenty-two minutes. You go into town, track down Young Biff, and tail him.',
'Sometime today, Old Biff will show up to give Young Biff the almanac. Above all you, must not interfere with that event.',
'We must let Old Biff believe he’s succeeded, so that he’ll leave 1955 and bring the DeLorean back to the future.',
'Right.',
'Once Old Biff is gone, grab the almanac any way that you can. Remember, both of our futures depend on this.',
'You don’t have to remind me of that, Doc.',
'Here’s some binoculars, and a walkie-talkie, so we can keep in contact.',
'I’ll stay here and try to repair the short in the time circuit.',
'That way, we don’t risk anyone else stealing the time machine, and I won’t risk accidentally running into my other self.',
'Your other self?',
'Yes. There are now two of me here, and there are two of you here.',
'The other me is the Doctor Emmett Brown from 1955, the younger me that helps the other you get back to 1985.',
'Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower?',
'Yeah.',
'That event doesn’t happen until tonight, so you must be very careful not to run into your other self.',
'Let me give you some money.',
'I have to be prepared for all monetary possibilities.',
'Get yourself some ‘50s clothes.',
'Check, Doc.',
'Something inconspicuous!',
'Doc. Come in, Doc. This is Marty. Over.',
'Roger, Marty. This is Doc. Are you there?',
'Yeah, Doc! I’m at the address. It’s the only Tannen in the book, but… I don’t think this is Biff’s house. It looks like some old lady lives here.',
'Biff!',
'Yeah, yeah, yeah…',
'Where ya goin’, Biff?!',
'I’m goin’ to get my car, Grandma!',
'When are ya coming back?! My feet hurt, and I want you to rub my toes s’more.',
'Shut up, you old bag.',
'Give us our ball back!',
'What ball?',
'That ball!',
'What ball you talkin’ about?',
'Give us our ball!',
'What ball?!',
'Biff!',
'Is this your ball?',
'Yeah!',
'Is it your ball? You want it back?',
'Yeah! Yeah!',
'Go get it!! Ha ha ha!',
'Doc. It is Biff’s house. I’m on him. Over.',
'Hey!',
'Lookin’ good, Terry.',
'Hey, Biff, she’s all fixed up, just like new, but I couldn’t get ‘er started. You got some kind of kill switch on this thing?',
'No, you just gotta have the right touch. Nobody can start this car but me.',
'Yeah, bill comes to $302.57.',
'Three hundred bucks?! Three hundred bucks for a couple of dents?! No, hey, that’s bullshit, Terry.',
'No, Biff, it was horse shit! The whole car was full of it! We had to pay Old Man Jones eighty bucks to haul it away!',
'Old Man Jones probably resold it too. Now I oughta get somethin’ for that.',
'You want somethin’ for it? We’ll go inside. You can call Old Man Jones. If he wants to give you a refund—',
'It’s three hundred bucks, Terry! If I catch the guy that caused this, I’ll break his neck!',
'The manure. I remember that.',
'Four cans of Valvoline is fair, Biff.',
'Four cans for a $300 job?!',
'I can’t even have lunch in the shop yet! It makes me nauseous!',
'I should get a case of oil out of you for a three-hundred-buck job.',
'You’ve been inside. It smells worse than the bathroom at a gas station!',
'You robbed me again, Terry.',
'The smell’s never gonna go away, Biff! Never gonna go away!',
'Yeah, yeah, yeah, Terry. Get away from my car.',
'Last time I do you a favor! Last time.',
'Thanks a lot.',
'Oh, ho ho! Let me see!',
'Oh, it’s perfect, Lorraine!',
'Oh, look at it!',
'You’re going to look so good!',
'Well, looky what we have here…',
'Hey, nice dress, Lorraine. Although I think you’d look better wearing nothin’ at all.',
'Biff, why don’t you take a long walk off a short pier?',
'Hey, listen, Lorraine. There’s that dance at school tonight, right? Now that my car’s all fixed, I figure I’d cut you a break and give you the honor of going with the best-looking guy in school.',
'Yeah, well, I’m busy.',
'Yeah, doing what?!',
'Washing my hair.',
'Ah, that’s about as funny as a screen door on a battleship.',
'Screen door on a submarine, you dork.',
'Look, Biff, somebody already asked me to the dance.',
'Who? That bug George McFly?',
'I’m going with Calvin Klein, okay?',
'Calvin Klein? No, it’s not okay. You’re going with me, understand?',
'Get your cooties off me!',
'When are you gonna get it through your thick skull, Lorraine? You’re my girl.',
'Biff Tannen, I wouldn’t be your girl even if… even if you had a million dollars!',
'Aah! Ooh!',
'Yes, you will! It’s you and me, Lorraine!',
'Watch it!',
'It’s meant to be! I’m going to marry you someday, Lorraine! Someday you’ll be my wife!!',
'You always did have a way with women.',
'Get the hell out of my car, old man!',
'You want to marry that girl, Biff? I can help make it happen.',
'Oh, yeah? Who are you, Miss Lonelyhearts?',
'Just get in the car, butthead.',
'Who are you calling butthead, butthead?',
'How do you know how to do that? Nobody can start this car but me.',
'Just get in the car, Tannen. Today’s your lucky day.',
'Hey—Hey! Hey! Hey, watch where you’re driving, old man! If you dent this car, I’ll kill you! Oh!',
'This cost me three hundred bucks!',
'Would you shut up about the car?',
'Hey, and another thing, how do you know where I live?!',
'Let’s just say we’re related, Biff. And that being the case, I got a little present for you. Somethin’ that’ll make you rich. You want to be rich, don’t you?',
'Oh, yeah. Sure. Right. That’s rich. Heh, hah. You’re gonna make me rich?',
'You see this book? This book tells the future. Tells the results of every major sports event till the end of the century. Football, baseball, horse races, boxing.',
'The information in here is worth millions, and I’m giving it to you.',
'Well, that’s very nice. Thank you very much. Now why don’t you make like a tree and get out of here?',
'It’s “leave”, you idiot! “Make like a tree and leave”! You sound like a damn fool when you say it wrong!',
'All right, then, leave! And take your book with you!',
'Don’t you get it? You could make a fortune with this book. Let me show you.',
'…yard line. UCLA trails seventeen to sixteen. It’s fourth and eleven with only eighteen seconds left of this game. I’d say it’s all over for UCLA.',
'Bet you a million bucks UCLA wins it nineteen to seventeen.',
'What are you, deaf, old man?! He just said it was over! You lost!',
'Oh, yeah?',
'…Here comes Decker with the kick. It’s up. It looks good, folks! It looks very good! Field goal! UCLA wins! Nineteen to seventeen! Listen to that Coliseum crowd go wild! Jim Decker, senior halfback…',
'All right, pops. What’s the gag? How did you know what the score was gonna be?',
'I told you. It’s in this book. All you gotta do is bet on the winner, and you’ll never lose.',
'All right. I’ll—I’ll take a look at it.',
'You damn fool! Never… never leave this book layin’ around!',
'Don’t—Don’t you have a safe?! No, you don’t have a safe.',
'Get a safe! Keep it locked up! And until then, keep it on you, like this.',
'Hey, what are you doing?',
'And don’t tell anybody about it either!',
'And there’s one more thing. One day, a kid or a crazy, wild-eyed old man who claims to be a scientist is gonna come around asking about this…',
'I’m trapped.',
'Doc? Doc, come in, Doc.',
'Marty, what’s the report?!',
'Biff’s gone. He’s got the book. The old man’s gone too.',
'I’m locked in Biff’s garage. You gotta fly the DeLorean over here and get me the hell out of here. The address is 1809 Mason Street.',
'I can’t take the DeLorean out in the daylight, but don’t worry, Marty. Somehow I’ll get over there.',
'No, Doc, wait a minute, Doc! Hey, Doc. Doc! Huh… Perfect.',
'Biff?! Biff! Where are you goin’ now?!',
'I told you, Grandma, I’m goin’ to the dance!',
'When ya comin’ home?!',
'The dance.',
'I will get home when I get home!',
'Don’t forget to turn off the garage light!',
'Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty, Marty! Damn! Where is that kid?',
'Doc! Doc, come in! Come in, Doc.',
'Marty, Marty, come in.',
'Doc.',
'Marty.',
'Oh, my… Great Scott.',
'Oh, my God!',
'Yo, Doc, Doc, come in!',
'Marty, what happened to you? I went to Biff’s house, and you weren’t there!',
'You must have just missed me. I’m in the back of Biff’s car. He’s on his way to the “Enchantment Under the Sea” dance!',
'Marty, listen, we may have to abort this entire plan! It’s getting much too dangerous!',
'Don’t worry. The book is on Biff’s dashboard. I’ll grab it as soon as we get to the school.',
'Marty, you must be extremely careful not to run into your other self!',
'My other self?',
'Yes! Remember? Your mother is at that exact same dance with you! Yeah!',
'Right. This could get heavy, Doc.',
'Heavy, heavy…',
'Marty, whatever happens, you must not let your other self see you—the consequences could be disastrous.',
'Excuse me, sir? Yes, you with the hat.',
'Who… me?',
'Yes. Be a pal and hand me a ⅝-inch wrench out of that toolbox.',
'⅝? Uh, don’t you mean… ¾?',
'Why… you’re right.',
'I presume… you’re conducting some sort of… weather experiment.',
'That’s right. How did you know that?',
'Oh, I happen to have had a little experience in this area.',
'Yes, well, I’m hoping to see some lightning tonight. Although the weatherman says there’s not gonna be any rain.',
'There’s going to be plenty of rain, all right. Wind, thunder, lightning. It’s gonna be one hell of a storm.',
'Well, thanks. Nice talking to you. Maybe we’ll bump into each other some time again in the future.',
'Or in the past.',
'Doc! Doc! Come in!',
'Where’s that punk Calvin Klein, anyway?',
'Um, how am I supposed to know, Biff? I ain’t his secretary.',
'Well, go find him! He caused three hundred bucks damage to my car, and I owe him a knuckle sandwich! Get going!',
'Drink up, Biff.',
'Hey, thanks.',
'Ain’t you coming?',
'I’m readin’.',
'Well, well, well, Mister Tannen. How nice to see you here.',
'Why, Mister Strickland, it’s nice to see you, sir.',
'Is that liquor I smell, Tannen?',
'Uh, I wouldn’t know. I don’t know what liquor smells like, ‘cause I’m too young to drink it.',
'I see. And what have we here?',
'Sports statistics, interesting subject. Homework, Tannen?',
'No, it ain’t homework, ‘cause, uh, I ain’t at home. Hee.',
'You’ve got a real attitude problem! You know that, Tannen? Just watch it!',
'Because one day, I’ll have you right where I want you, in detention!',
'Slacker!',
'Jesus, you smoke too?!',
'Marty, you’re beginning to sound just like my mother.',
'Yeah, right.',
'When I have kids, I’m going to let ‘em do anything they want. Anything at all.',
'Yeah, I’d like to have that in writing.',
'Yeah, me too.',
'Marty, why are you so nervous?',
'Yes!!',
'No…!',
'“Oh LàLà”? …“Oh LàLà”? …“Oh LàLà”?',
'Doc! Doc!',
'Hey, you. Get your damn hands off her.',
'Doc, damn it, come in!',
'Marty, what’s up?!',
'Doc! Doc, I’m in trouble, I blew it!',
'Where’s the book?!',
'I don’t know, Biff must still have it with him, all I got is the damn cover!',
'Then where’s Biff?!',
'You’re asking for it. And now you’re gonna get.',
'I don’t know!',
'Don’t you have any idea where he is?!',
'No! I mean, he could be anywhere by now!',
'Marty, the entire future depends on you finding Biff and getting that book back!',
'I know! I just don’t know where…!',
'Stop it! Stop it, Biff! You’ll break his arm! Stop it!',
'Of course!! I gotta go! I got one chance! My old man is about to deck Biff!!',
'Yes!',
'Talk about déjà vu.',
'Are you okay?',
'Okay, everybody! Let’s back up now, huh? Let’s back up. Let’s everybody just back up and give him a little bit of room, okay, a little bit of air. It’s okay. I know CPR.',
'I know CPR.',
'Hey…',
'What’s CPR?',
'You!',
'He’s fine.',
'Hey, did you just take his wallet? He just took that guy’s wallet!',
'Doc! Success. I got it.',
'Ah, thank goodness. Great, Marty! As soon as I reload the fusion generator, I’ll meet you on the roof of the high school gym.',
'On the roof. 10-4.',
'Hey! It’s him!',
'Hey, he’s in disguise!',
'Guys, what’s that?!',
'Oo!',
'Come on! Let’s get him!',
'Damn!',
'…Earth angel, please be mine. 🎵',
'My darling dear, love you for all time. 🎵',
'I’m just a fool, a fool in love… with you. 🎵',
'All right! Let’s do another one.',
'Where did he go?!',
'He just came in here!',
'…Something that really cooks…',
'Look! How did he get up on stage?!',
'I don’t know, but when he gets down, we’re gonna nail him.',
'How the hell he change his clothes so fast?',
'Uh, right, it’s an oldie where I come from.',
'All right, guys, uh, listen. This is a blues riff in B. Watch me for the changes, and try and keep up, okay?',
'Doc! Doc, come in!',
'Marty, come in!',
'Listen, Biff’s guys chased me into the gym, and they’re going to jump… me!',
'Then get out of there!',
'No, Doc, not me. The other me! The one that’s up on stage playing Johnny B. Goode!',
'Great Scott! Your other self will miss the lightning bolt at the clock tower, you won’t get back to the future, and we’ll have a major paradox!',
'Wait, wait—a paradox?! You mean one of those things that can destroy the universe?!',
'Precisely! Marty, you have to stop those guys at all costs, but without being seen by your other self or your parents.',
'10-4!',
'Huh?! What the hell?!',
'Where is he?',
'Who?',
'Calvin Klein!',
'Who?!',
'The guy with the hat, where is he?!',
'Oh! He went that way!',
'I think he took your wallet!',
'I think he took his wallet.',
'…Go, Johnny, go, no, go! Johnny B. Goode. 🎶',
'Go, go! Go, Johnny, go, no! Go, Johnny, go, no, go! Go, Johnny, go, no! Go, Johnny, go, go, go! Johnny B. Goode. 🎶',
'I guess you guys aren’t ready for that yet. But your kids are going to love it.',
'Hey, Doc! Success. Everything’s cool.',
'Great! I’ll be landing at the school roof in about one minute.',
'I’ll be there.',
'Lorraine.',
'Marty. That was very interesting music.',
'I hope you don’t mind, but George asked if he could take me home.',
'Uh—Great! Lorraine, I have a feeling about you two.',
'I have a feeling too.',
'Hey, butthead! You think that stupid disguise would get by me?',
'Let’s have it out. You and me. Right now.',
'No, thanks.',
'What’s the matter? Where are you going?! Are you chicken?!',
'That’s it, isn’t it? Nothing but a little chicken.',
'Nobody calls me chick—',
'What the hell? You steal my stuff?',
'And this one’s for my car!',
'Doc! I blew it. Biff nailed me. He took the book and drove away with it in his car.',
'It’s my fault, Doc! I shoulda got out of there sooner!',
'No time for that now. Which way did he go?',
'East towards the River Road Tunnel!',
'Get in!',
'Yes! There he is, Doc!',
'Let’s land on him. We’ll cripple his car.',
'Marty, he’s in a ‘46 Ford. We’re a DeLorean. He’d rip through us like we were tin foil.',
'So what do we do?',
'I have a plan.',
'Repeating tonight’s earlier weather bulletin, a severe thunderstorm is heading for Hill Valley…',
'…Serving Hill Valley and all of Hill County, you’re tuned to KKHV, the voice of Hill Valley.',
'Turning to community calendar, the Hill Valley Women’s Club bake sale will be held tomorrow afternoon from 2 to 5 at the community center on Forest Road.',
'For you sports fans out there, there was a lot of action today in college football. Here’s what happened to the top ten.',
'UCLA narrowly defeated Washington, nineteen to seventeen.',
'Michigan State crushed Minnesota, forty-two to fourteen.',
'Ohio State beat Iowa, twenty to ten.',
'Michigan blanked Indiana, thirty to nothing.',
'Shit!',
'It was Notre Dame over North Carolina, twenty-seven to seven.',
'Son of a bitch.',
'Oklahoma ripped Iowa State, fifty-two to nothing.',
'West Virginia lost to Pittsburgh, twenty-six to seven.',
'Texas A&M over Rice, twenty to ten.',
'Maryland defeated Clemson, twenty-five to twelve.',
'And it was Texas Christian over Texas, forty-seven to twenty.',
'Repeating tonight’s earlier weather bulletin, a severe thunderstorm…',
'You again?! Give me that book! Let it go!',
'Whoa!!',
'Let go of the car!!',
'That’ll teach him.',
'Oh!',
'Go, Doc!',
'Hold on, Marty!',
'Shit!',
'Ah, ha ha! Yes!',
'Manure! I hate manure!',
'Doc! Is everything all right? Over.',
'10-4, Marty.',
'But it’s pretty miserable flying weather. Much too turbulent to make a landing from this direction. I’ll have to circle around and make a long approach from the south.',
'Have you got the book?',
'In my hand, Doc! I got it in my hand!',
'Burn it!',
'Check!',
'Doc! Doc! That newspaper changed. Doc, my father’s alive! That means everything’s back to normal, right?',
'Mission accomplished.',
'That means Jennifer’s okay and Einie’s okay, right?!',
'That’s right, Marty! It’s the ripple effect! The future is back, so let’s go home!',
'Right. Let’s get our asses back to the fu—',
'Doc, Doc, are you okay?!',
'That was a close one, Marty. I almost bought the farm.',
'Well, be careful! You don’t want to get struck by lightning!',
'Doc. …Doc?',
'Doc, come in, Doc. Doc, do you read me? Do you read me, Doc? Come in. Doc!',
'Oh, no. He’s gone. The doc’s gone.',
'Mister McFly!',
'Huh?',
'Is your name Marty McFly?!',
'Yeah.',
'I’ve got somethin’ for you. A letter.',
'A letter for me?! That’s impossible! Who the hell are you?!',
'Western Union.',
'Actually, a bunch of us at the office were kind of hoping maybe you could shed some light on the subject.',
'See, we’ve had that envelope in our possession for the past seventy years.',
'It was given to us with the explicit instructions that it be delivered to a young man with your description, answering to the name of Marty, at this exact location, at this exact minute, November 12, 1955.',
'We have a little bet going as to whether this Marty would actually be here. Looks like I lost. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!',
'Did you say seventy years?',
'Yeah, seventy years, two months, uh, twelve days, to be exact. Here, sign on line six, please. Here you are.',
'It’s from the doc!',
'“Dear Marty, if my calculations are correct, you will receive this letter immediately after you saw the DeLorean struck by lightning.',
'“First, let me assure you that I’m alive and well. I’ve been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885.',
'“The lightning bolt…” 1885! September, 1885!',
'Wait, wait, kid! Wait a minute! What’s this all about?!',
'He’s alive! The doc’s alive! He’s in the Old West, but he’s alive!',
'Yeah, but, kid! You all right?! Need any help?!',
'There’s only one man who can help me.',
'Doc!',
'Ahh!!! Hah! Ah!! Ah, ha! Ah, ha ha ha…!',
'Doc! Doc! Doc! Doc!! Doc!',
'What? Ahh!!',
'Okay, relax, Doc. It’s me. It’s me! It’s Marty!',
'No, it can’t be! I just sent you back to the future.',
'Yeah, no, I know. You did send me back to the future.',
'But I’m back. I’m back from the future.',
'Great Scott…!',
'Doc! Doc. Doc. Oh… Fantastic.',
'TO BE CONCLUDED…',
'BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III',
'Screenplay by BOB GALE\nStory by ROBERT ZEMECKIS & BOB GALE',
'Hey, kids, what time is it?!',
'Howdy Doody time!',
'Great Scott!',
'It’s Howdy Doody time. It’s Howdy Doody time. Bob Smith, and Howdy too, say howdy-do to you. 🎼',
'Howdy Doody time?',
'Let’s give a rousing cheer— 🎼',
'Date: Sunday, November 13, 1955, 7:01 AM.',
'Last night’s time travel experiment was apparently a complete success.',
'Lightning struck the clock tower at precisely 10:04 PM, sending the necessary 1.21 gigawatts into the time vehicle, which vanished in a brilliant flash of light, leaving a pair of fire trails behind!',
'I therefore assume that Marty and the time vehicle were transported forward through time into the year 1985!',
'After that—ah—after that, I can’t recall what happened. In fact, I don’t even remember how I got home!',
'Perhaps the gigawatt discharge, coupled with the temporal displacement field generated by the time vehicle, caused a disruption of my own brain waves, resulting in a condition of momentary amnesia!',
'Indeed I now recall that moments after the time vehicle disappeared into the future—ah—I saw a vision of Marty saying he had come back from the future.',
'Hey, Doc?',
'Undoubtedly this was some sort of residual image—',
'Doc.',
'Aargh!!',
'Doc. Calm down, okay? Just calm down! It’s me! It’s Marty!',
'No, it can’t be you! I sent you back to the future!!',
'Okay, Doc. That’s right. But I came back again. I came back from the future.',
'Don’t you remember last night? You fainted. I brought you home!',
'This can’t be happening!! You can’t be here!! It doesn’t make sense for you to be here!! I refuse to even believe that you are here!',
'Doc, I am here, and it does make sense! Look, I came back to 1955 again with you—the you from 1985—‘cause we had to get a book from Biff!',
'So once I got the book back, you—that is, the you from 1985—were in the DeLorean, and it got struck by lightning, and you got sent back to 1885!',
'1885?!',
'It’s a very interesting story, future boy. But there’s just one little thing that doesn’t make sense. If the me of the future is now in the past, how could you possibly know about it?',
'You sent me a letter.',
'“Dear Marty, if my calculations are correct, you will receive this letter immediately after you saw the DeLorean struck by lightning.',
'“First, let me assure you that I’m alive and well. I’ve been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885.',
'“The lightning bolt that hit the DeLorean caused a gigawatt overload, which scrambled the time circuits, activated the flux capacitor, and sent me back to 1885.',
'“The overload shorted out the time circuits and destroyed the flying circuits. Unfortunately, the car will never fly again.”',
'It actually flew?',
'Yeah, well, you had a hover conversion done in the early twenty-first century.',
'Incredible!',
'“I set myself up as a blacksmith as a front, while I attempted to repair the damage to the time circuits. Unfortunately, this proved impossible, because suitable replacement parts will not be invented until 1947.',
'“However, I’ve gotten quite adept at shoeing horses and fixing wagons.”',
'1885! Amazing! I actually end up as a blacksmith in the Old West.',
'Pretty heavy, huh?',
'“I have buried the DeLorean in the abandoned Delgado Mine adjacent to the old Boot Hill Cemetery, as shown on the enclosed map. Hopefully it should remain undisturbed and preserved until you uncover it in 1955.',
'“Inside, you will find repair instructions. My 1955 counterpart”—that’s me—“should have no problem repairing it so that you can drive it back to the future.',
'“Once you have returned to 1985, destroy the time machine.”',
'Destroy it?',
'Yeah, well, it’s a long story, Doc.',
'“Do not, I repeat, do not attempt to come back here to get me.',
'“I am perfectly happy living in the fresh air and wide-open spaces, and I fear that unnecessary time travel only risks further disruption of the space-time continuum.',
'“And please take care of Einstein for me.”',
'Einstein?',
'He’s your dog, Doc. Einstein is what you call your dog in 1985.',
'“I know you will give him a good home. Remember to walk him twice a day, and that he only likes canned dog food.',
'“These are my wishes. Please respect them and follow them.',
'“And so, Marty, I now say farewell and wish you Godspeed. You’ve been a good, kind, and loyal friend to me, and you made a real difference in my life.',
'“I will always treasure our relationship and think on you with fond memories, warm feelings, and a special place in my heart.',
'“Your friend in time, ‘Doc’ Emmett L. Brown, September 1, 1885.”',
'I never knew I could write anything so touching.',
'I know, I know, Doc. It’s beautiful.',
'It’s all right, Copernicus. Everything’s gonna be fine.',
'I’m sorry, Doc. It’s all my fault you’re stuck back there. I never should’ve let Biff get to me!',
'There are plenty worse places to be than the Old West.',
'I could have ended up in the Dark Ages. They probably would have burned me at the stake as a heretic or something.',
'Let’s look at the map.',
'All right, according to this, the time vehicle is sealed off in a side tunnel. We may have to blast.',
'Whoa… I think you woke up the dead with that blast!',
'Take this camera, I want to document everything!',
'This reminds me of the time I attempted to reach the center of the earth. I’d been reading my favorite author, Jules Verne.',
'I spent weeks preparing that expedition; I didn’t even get this far.',
'Of course, I was only twelve at the time.',
'You know, it was the writings of Jules Verne that had a profound effect on my life.',
'It was when I was eleven that I first read “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea”.',
'It was then that I realized that I must devote my life to science.',
'Doc, check it out. Look at this.',
'My initials! Just like in “Journey to the Center of the Earth”! That means the time machine must be right through this wall!',
'It’s been buried in here for seventy years, two months, and thirteen days. Astounding!',
'“As you can see, the lightning bolt shorted out the time-circuit control microchip.',
'“The attached sche…”',
'Schematic.',
'Schematic. “…Schematic diagram will allow you to build a replacement unit with 1955 components, thus restoring the time machine to perfect working order.”',
'Unbelievable that this little piece of junk could be such a big problem.',
'No wonder this circuit failed. It says: “Made in Japan”.',
'What do you mean, Doc? All the best stuff is made in Japan.',
'Unbelievable!',
'You know, when I was a kid, I always wanted to be a cowboy.',
'And now, knowing I’m gonna spend my future in the past, it sounds like a wonderful way to spend my retirement years.',
'It just occurred to me, Marty, since I end up in 1885, perhaps I’m now in the history books.',
'I wonder. Could I go to the library and look myself up in the old newspaper archives?',
'I don’t know, Doc. You’re the one that’s always saying, you know, it’s not good to know too much about your own destiny?',
'You’re right, Marty. I know too much already. Better that I not attempt to uncover the circumstances of my own future.',
'Copernicus! Come on, boy!',
'I’ll get him, Doc.',
'Copernicus! Copernicus, come on, let’s go home, boy!',
'What’s wrong? What’s wrong, Copernicus? Come on.',
'Come on, let’s go home. Come on. Come on.',
'Doc!! Doc!! Come here, quick!',
'What’s wrong, Marty? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.',
'You’re not far off, Doc.',
'Great Scott!',
'Check this out: “Died… September 7, 1885”—that’s one week after you wrote the letter!',
'“Erected… in eternal memory by his beloved Clara”… Who the hell is Clara?!',
'Marty, please don’t stand there!',
'Oh! Right. Sorry.',
'I gotta get another picture.',
'“Shot in the back… by Buford Tannen… over a matter of $80”?! What kind of a future do you call that?!',
'“Buford Tannen was a notorious gunman… whose short temper… and a tendency to drool… earned him the nickname “Mad Dog”.',
'“He was quick on the trigger and bragged that he had killed twelve men… not including Indians or Chinamen.”',
'Does it mention me? Am I one of the twelve?',
'Just a minute. “However, this claim cannot be substantiated, since precise records were not kept after Tannen shot a newspaper editor who printed an unfavorable story about him in 1884.” That’s why we can’t find anything.',
'Look… William McFly and family. Your relatives?',
'My great-grandfather’s name was William. That’s him. Good-looking guy.',
'McFlys… but no Browns.',
'Well, maybe it was a mistake, Doc. Maybe that grave wasn’t yours. There could’ve been another Emmett Brown back in 1885.',
'No.',
'I don’t know. Did you have any relatives here back then?',
'The Browns didn’t come to Hill Valley until 1908. And then they were the von Brauns.',
'My father changed our name during the First World War.',
'Doc, look.',
'Great Scott. It’s me!',
'Then it is true. All of it. It is me who goes back there and gets shot.',
'It’s not gonna happen, Doc.',
'After you fix the time circuits and put new tires on the DeLorean, I’m goin’ back to 1885, and I’m bringing you home!',
'The clothes fit?',
'Yeah, everything except the boots, Doc. They’re kinda tight.',
'I don’t know. Are you sure this stuff is authentic?',
'Of course. Haven’t you ever seen a Western?',
'Yeah, I have, Doc. Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this.',
'Clint who?',
'That’s right. You haven’t heard of him yet.',
'Marty, you have to wear the boots. You can’t wear those futuristic things back in 1885. You shouldn’t even be wearing them here in 1955!',
'All right, Doc, look—as soon as I get there, I’ll put them on. I promise.',
'Okay. I think we’re about ready. I put gas in the tank. Your future clothes are packed. Just in case, fresh batteries for your walkie-talkies.',
'Oh! What about that floating device?',
'Hoverboard.',
'All right.',
'You know, Doc, it’s gonna be a hell of a long walk back to Hill Valley from here.',
'It’s still the safest plan. After all, we can’t risk sending you back into a populated area or to a spot that’s geographically unknown. You don’t want to crash into some tree that once existed in the past.',
'This was all completely open country, so you’ll have plenty of run-out space when you arrive. Remember, where you’re going, there are no roads.',
'There’s a small cave over there, which will be a perfect place to hide the time vehicle.',
'Well, the new time-circuit control tubes are warmed up.',
'Time circuits on.',
'I wrote the letter on September 1, so we’ll send you back the very next day, September 2. That’s a Wednesday. September 2, 1885, 8 AM.',
'I get shot on Monday the seventh, so you have five days to locate me. According to my letter, I’m a blacksmith, so I probably have a shop somewhere.',
'All you have to do is drive the time vehicle directly toward that screen, accelerating to 88 miles an hour.',
'Wait a minute. Doc, if I drive straight towards the screen, I’m gonna crash into those Indians.',
'Marty, you’re not thinking fourth-dimensionally.',
'You’ll instantly be transported to 1885, and those Indians won’t even be there.',
'Right…',
'Well… Good luck, for both of our sakes. See you in the future.',
'You mean the past.',
'Exactly!',
'Happy trails, Marty!',
'Ready, Marty?!',
'Ready!',
'Set!',
'Hi ho, Silver.',
'¡Vaya con Dios!',
'Indians!!',
'Ahhh!!',
'The cave!',
'Charge!',
'Shit! The cavalry!',
'Damn, I ripped the fuel line.',
'Ah! Ahhh!! Ah! Ah! Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah! Aargh!',
'Maggie! Fetch some water! We got a hurt man here.',
'Mom? Mom, is that you?',
'There, there now. You’ve been asleep for nearly six hours now.',
'I had this horrible nightmare.',
'I… dreamed I wa… I dreamed I was in a Western. I was being chased by all these Indians… and a bear.',
'Well, you’re safe and sound here now at the McFly farm.',
'McFly farm?! Aah!',
'Well, you’re my… You’re my, my… Who are you?',
'The name’s McFly. Maggie McFly.',
'McFly? Maggie?',
'And that’s Missus McFly, and don’t you be forgetting the Missus. And what might your name be, sir?',
'Well, it’s… McFl–Uh… Eastwood. Uh, Clint—Clint Eastwood.',
'Well, you hit your head, Mister Eastwood. Not too serious, but lucky for you, Seamus found you when he did.',
'Seamus.',
'Me husband.',
'You’ll be excusing me, Mister Eastwood, while I tend to William.',
'William.',
'Oh, that’s okay, Will. It’s okay.',
'That’s William?',
'Aye. William Sean McFly, the first of our family to be born in America.',
'Oh, it’s okay, Will. This here is Mister Clint Eastwood, here visitin’.',
'He surely likes you, Mister Eastwood.',
'Maggie. I’ve got supper.',
'I’m not one to pry into a man’s personal affairs, but… exactly… how is it that you came to be way out here without a horse, or boots, or hat?',
'Well, my car—horse broke down, and a bear ate my boots, and I guess I just forgot my hat.',
'How could you forget a thing like your hat?!',
'Would you like some water?',
'Uh, yeah.',
'I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Mister Eastwood. I’ll help you find your blacksmith friend.',
'You can stay the night in the barn, and tomorrow I’ll take you as far as the railroad tracks. You can follow ‘em straight on into town.',
'I’ll even give you a hat.',
'That’s great.',
'Thanks.',
'Ah… That’s my William… Oh…',
'Yes. I think you’ll find the barn comfortable. Never had any complaints about it from the pigs. Huh.',
'Mmm.',
'Seamus. A word with you.',
'Aye.',
'Will you hold him for a minute?',
'Are you sure you’re not after bringin’ a curse on this house, takin’ in ‘im like that?',
'He’s such a strange young man.',
'Aye, but I’ve just got a feelin’ about ‘im, Maggie. That lookin’ after ‘im’s the right thing to do. That it’s important.',
'Hey, buddy.',
'Look how the babby takes to ‘im. Little Will never takes to strangers. It’s almost as if… he’s connected to us.',
'Hey, Will. So you’re my great-grandfather. The first McFly born in America.',
'And you peed on me.',
'Eh, give me some soap, Wang.',
'Ah, here you go.',
'Hyah!',
'Take a look and see what just breezed in the door.',
'Why, I didn’t know the circus was in town!',
'Must have got that shirt off from a dead Chinee.',
'Ah, ha ha!',
'What’ll it be, stranger?',
'Uh… I’ll have a… ice water.',
'Ice water?',
'Water? You want water, you better go dunk your head in the horse trough out there. In here… we pour whiskey.',
'Excuse me.',
'For what?',
'I’m trying to find the blacksmith.',
'Hey, McFly!',
'Thought I done told you never to come in…',
'Hey, you ain’ Seamus McFly.',
'You look like him, though. ‘Specially wear that dog-ugly hat.',
'Ah, heh heh heh heh heh heh, hah…',
'You kin to that hay barber?',
'What’s your name, dude?!',
'Uh, Mart—Eastwood. Clint Eastwood.',
'Hah hah hah hah hah…',
'What kind of stupid name is that?',
'I’d say he’s the runt of the litter.',
'Hey now, boys. Would you take a look-see at these pearly whites? Hell, I ain’t seen teeth look that straight that weren’t store-bought.',
'Hey, take a gander at them moccasins. What kind of skins is them? What’s that writin’ mean? “Nee-Kay”? What is that, some sort of Injun talk or somethin’?',
'Ah, heh heh heh…',
'Bartender. I’m looking for that no-good, cheatin’ blacksmith. You seen him?',
'No, sir, Mister Tannen. I have not.',
'Tannen? You’re “Mad Dog” Tannen.',
'“Mad Dog”? I hate that name. I hate it, you hear?! Nobody calls me “Mad Dog”! ‘Specially not some… duded-up, egg-suckin’ gutter trash.',
'Aah!',
'Dance!!',
'Ah!',
'Come on! Come on, runt! You can dance better than that!',
'Shit.',
'Whoo!',
'Oh…',
'You better run, squirrel!',
'Go on, get him!',
'Whoa! Oh, ho ho…',
'We got ourselves a new courthouse! High time we had a hangin’!',
'Yeah!!',
'Woo, hoo hoo hoo! Look at him swing!',
'Yeah! Haven’t had a hangin’ in a long time!',
'It’ll shoot the fleas off a dog’s back at five hundred yards, Tannen! And it’s pointed straight at your head!',
'You owe me money, blacksmith.',
'How do you figure?',
'My horse threw a shoe. And seein’ as you was the one that done the shoein’, I say that makes you responsible.',
'Well, since you never paid me for the job, I say that makes us even!',
'Wrong! See I was on my horse when it threw the shoe, and I got throwed off! And that caused me to bust a perfectly good bottle of fine Kentucky red eye.',
'So the way I figure it, blacksmith, you owe me $5 for the whiskey and $75 for the horse!',
'That’s the $80.',
'Look, if your horse threw a shoe, bring him back, and I’ll re-shoe him.',
'I done shot that horse!',
'Well, that’s your problem, Tannen!',
'Wrong. That’s yours.',
'So from now on, you better be looking behind you when you walk! ‘Cause one day you’re gonna get a bullet in your back!',
'Doc…!',
'Marty… I gave you explicit instructions not to come here but to go directly back to 1985.',
'I know, Doc, I had to c—',
'But it’s good to see you, Marty.',
'Marty, you’re gonna have to do something about those clothes. You walk around town dressed like that, you’re liable to get shot.',
'Or hanged.',
'What idiot dressed you in that outfit?',
'You did.',
'“Shot in the back… by Buford Tannen… over a matter of $80… September 7”?! That’s this Monday!',
'Now I wish I’d paid him off!',
'And who’s this beloved Clara? I don’t know anyone named Clara!',
'I don’t know, Doc!',
'I thought maybe she was a girlfriend of yours.',
'Marty, my involvement in such a social relationship here in 1885 could result in a disruption of the space-time continuum.',
'As a scientist, I can never take that risk. Certainly not after what we’ve already been through.',
'Emmett! Hello, Emmett!',
'Hubert!',
'It’s the mayor.',
'Excuse me, Emmett.',
'Do you remember last week at the town meeting when you volunteered to meet the new schoolteacher at the station when she came in?',
'Oh, yes, quite so!',
'Well, we just got word she’s comin’ in tomorrow. Here are the details for you. Thanks for all your help.',
'Anytime, Hubert!',
'Oh! Her name’s Miss Clayton. Clara Clayton.',
'Well, Doc… Now we know who Clara is!',
'Marty, it’s impossible. The idea that I could fall in love at first sight? It’s romantic nonsense.',
'Ah, ha ha…',
'There’s no scientific rationale for that concept.',
'Aw, come on, Doc. It’s not science. You meet the right girl, it just hits you. It’s like lightnin’.',
'Marty, please don’t say that.',
'That’s the way it was for me and Jennifer! I mean, we couldn’t keep our eyes off each other!',
'God, Jennifer, damn. I hope she’s all right, Doc! I can’t believe we just left her there on the porch!',
'Don’t worry, Marty. She’ll be fine.',
'When you burned the almanac in 1955, the normal timeline was restored. That means once we’re back in 1985, you just have to go over to her house to wake her up.',
'Oh, Marty! Turn that valve over there! All the way to the right! Yeah, pull it all the way around! Okay, let’s go!',
'Iced tea?',
'No, thanks.',
'It’s a refrigerator.',
'Well, I guess Miss Clayton will have to find other transportation.',
'If I never meet the woman, there’s no possibility of a romantic infatuation, right?!',
'You’re the doc, Doc.',
'All right! We’ll get the DeLorean and get ourselves back to the future.',
'Oh, listen, Doc. I tore a hole in the gas tank when I was landing, so we’re gonna have to patch it up and get some gas.',
'You mean we’re out of gas?',
'Yeah, it’s no big deal. We’ve got Mr. Fusion, right?',
'Mr. Fusion powers the time circuits and the flux capacitor, but the internal combustion engine runs on ordinary gasoline. It always has.',
'There’s not gonna be a gas station around here until sometime in the next century.',
'Without gasoline, we can’t get the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour.',
'So what do we do?',
'Hyah! Hyah!',
'24!',
'It’s no use, Marty! Even the fastest horse in the world… won’t run more than 35, 40 miles an hour!',
'Bartender said that’s the strongest stuff they got.',
'Try it, Marty.',
'Give it more gas!',
'Damn! It blew the fuel injection manifold.',
'Strong stuff, all right. It will take me a month to rebuild it.',
'A month? Doc, you’re gonna get shot on Monday!',
'I know! I know! I know!',
'I wish… Wait… I’ve got it! We can simply roll it down a steep hill!',
'No! We’d never find a smooth enough surface!',
'Unless… Of course… Ice. We’ll wait until winter, when the lake freezes over—',
'Winter?! Doc, what are you talking about?! Monday! It’s three days away!',
'All right, all right, all right. Just, let’s think this thing through logically.',
'We know it won’t run under its own power. We know we can’t pull it. But… if we could figure out a way to push it up to 88 miles an hour. Huh?',
'That’s it!',
'How fast can she go? Why, I’ve had her up to 55 myself. I heard that, uh, Fearless Frank Fargo got one of these up to near 70 out past Verde Junction.',
'Well, do you think it’s possible to get it up to 90?',
'Heh, 90?! Tarnation, son, who’d ever need to be in such a hurry?!',
'Well, it’s just a little bet he and I have, that’s all! Theoretically speaking, could it be done?!',
'Well, I suppose, if you had a straight stretch of track with a level grade, and you weren’t hauling no cars behind you…',
'And if you could get the fire hot enough, and I’m talking about hotter than the blazes of hell and damnation itself… Then yes, sir, it might be possible to get her up that fast!',
'Tell me, when’s the next train come through here?!',
'Monday mornin’ at 8:00.',
'Here! This spur that runs off the main line three miles out to Clayton Ravine. It’s a long stretch of level track that will still exist in 1985. This is where we’ll push the DeLorean with the locomotive.',
'Funny. This map calls Clayton Ravine “Shonash Ravine”. That must be the old Indian name for it.',
'It’s perfect. A nice long run that goes clear across the bridge over the ravine, you know, over near that Hilldale housing development.',
'Right, Doc, but according to this map, there is no bridge.',
'Well, Doc, we can scratch that idea. I mean, we can’t wait a year and a half for this thing to get finished.',
'Marty, it’s perfect. You’re just not thinking fourth-dimensionally.',
'Right. Right. I have a real problem with that.',
'Don’t you see? The bridge will exist in 1985. It’s safe and still in use.',
'Therefore, as long as we get the DeLorean up to 88 miles an hour before we hit the edge of the ravine, we’ll instantaneously arrive at a point in time where the bridge is completed.',
'We’ll have track under us and coast safely across the ravine!',
'What about the locomotive?',
'It will be a spectacular wreck! Too bad no one will be around to see it.',
'Aargh! Help me! Help!',
'Great Scott!',
'Doc!',
'Hyah! Hyah!',
'Hurry!',
'Jump!',
'Ah!',
'Whoa…',
'Whoa.',
'Oh. Thank you, sir. You saved my… life.',
'Emmett Brown at your service, Miss…',
'Um… Um… Clayton. Clara Clayton.',
'Clara… What a beautiful name.',
'May I help you inside with these?',
'Oh, no, that won’t be necessary. I can take care of it. You’ve done more than enough already.',
'But it’s really no trouble.',
'Doc, she says it’s fine, and we got to get going.',
'Ma’am, good luck with your school teaching and everythin’.',
'Clara, I’ll straighten everything out with Mister Statler for the buckboard rental. Don’t you worry about that. I feel somewhat responsible for what happened.',
'Oh. Well, it would be very gentlemanly of you, Mister Brown. Emmett.',
'You know, I’m—I’m almost glad that snake spooked those horses. Otherwise, we might never have met. I suppose it was destiny.',
'Well, thank you for everything.',
'You’re quite welcome.',
'I will see you again, won’t I?',
'Of course. You’ll see lots of me. I’m sure. I have a shop in town. I’m the local scientist—eh, uh, ah, blacksmith.',
'Science? What sort of science? Uh, astronomy? Chemistry?',
'Actually, I’m a student of all sciences.',
'Hey, Doc… We gotta get going.',
'Oh, yes. Well, excuse us, Clara. We have to get going.',
'Toodle-oo.',
'What do you mean, you’re gonna be seeing lots of her, Doc?',
'Well… I might see her again, just in passing.',
'Come on, Doc. Did you see the way she was looking at you?',
'Ah, hah. She did have quite a scare, right?',
'After all, Miss Clayton almost ended up at the bottom of Clayton Ravine. Clayton Ravine…',
'Holy shit! Hey, Doc! Clayton Ravine was named after a teacher. They say she fell in there a hundred years ago.',
'A hundred years ago?! That’s this year!',
'Every kid in school knows that story, ‘cause we all have teachers we’d like to see fall into the ravine.',
'Great Scott! Then she was supposed to go over in that wagon, and… And now I may have seriously altered history.',
'Look, Doc, what’s the worst that can happen, huh? So they don’t name the ravine after her.',
'Let’s just get the DeLorean ready and get the hell out of here.',
'I wish I’d never invented that infernal time machine. It’s caused nothing but disaster.',
'Doc, Doc, this is Marty. Do you read me? Over.',
'Check, Marty.',
'Great, Doc. These things still work!',
'All right, Marty. Once more, let’s go over the entire plan and layout.',
'I apologize for the crudity of this model, but I just—',
'Yeah, I know, Doc. It’s not to scale. It’s okay, Doc.',
'All right. Tomorrow night, Sunday, we’ll load the DeLorean onto the tracks here, on the spur right by the old abandoned silver mine.',
'The switch track is where the spur runs off the main line three miles out to Clayton—Shonash Ravine.',
'The train leaves the station at 8, Monday morning.',
'We’ll stop it here, uncouple the cars from the tender, throw the switch track, and then we’ll hijack—borrow the locomotive and use it to push the time machine.',
'According to my calculations, we’ll reach 88 miles per hour just before we hit the edge of the ravine, at which point we’ll be instantaneously transported back to 1985 and coast safely across the completed bridge.',
'What does this mean: “Point of No Return”?',
'That’s our fail-safe point. Up until there, we still have enough time to stop the locomotive before it plunges into the ravine. But once we pass this windmill, it’s the future or bust.',
'Here you go, Marty! Connect that to the positive terminal.',
'All right, Marty, you all set?',
'Yeah, yeah! Go!',
'Train pulling out of the station!',
'Coming up to the switch track!',
'Stop at the switch track!',
'Throw the switch!',
'Pull up to the DeLorean!',
'Pushing the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour!',
'It couldn’t be simpler.',
'Hello…? Emmett…?',
'It’s Clara! Quick! Cover the DeLorean!',
'Hello.',
'Why, hello. This is quite a surprise.',
'Well, I hope I’m not disturbing anything.',
'Oh, no, no, we were just doing a little model railroading.',
'Oh. Emmett, when my bags were thrown from the wagon, my telescope was damaged. And since you mentioned an interest in science, I thought you might be able to repair it for me.',
'I—I would pay you, of course.',
'Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn’t think of charging you for this.',
'Well, let’s have a look at it.',
'I think a lens may be out of alignment, because if you move it this way, the image turns fuzzy. See?',
'But if you turn it… the other way… then…',
'Everything becomes… clear.',
'Ahem.',
'I could repair it right away and have it for you tonight.',
'Oh, tonight is the town festival. I wouldn’t dream of having you work on my telescope during such an important occasion. You are planning on attending, aren’t you?',
'Well, actually, ma’am, I don’t think—',
'Yes, of course, the festival.',
'Well, in that case, I’ll see you this evening at the festival, Emmett. Mister Eastwood.',
'Ma’am.',
'Thank you for taking care of my telescope.',
'You’re quite welcome.',
'It’s a nice telescope.',
'Ladies and gentlemen, as mayor of Hill Valley, it gives me great pleasure to dedicate this clock to the people of Hill County! May it stand for all time!',
'Tell me when, gentlemen.',
'Three…! Two…! One…! Now!',
'Let the festivities begin!',
'You know, Marty, in a way, it’s fitting that you and I are here to witness this.',
'It’s too bad I didn’t bring my camera.',
'Ready, gentlemen?',
'The only problem is we’ll never be able to show it to anybody.',
'Smile, Doc.',
'Yee-ha!',
'What great music!',
'Yeah, it’s got a beat, and you can dance to it!',
'Step right up, gentlemen, and test your mettle with the latest products from Colonel Samuel Colt’s Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut.',
'Now take this model, for example. The new, improved, and refined Colt Peacemaker, selling to you tonight for the low, low price of $12…',
'Good evening.',
'Evening.',
'You look very nice.',
'Thank you.',
'Would you like, uh… Would you care to—to, uh…',
'I’d love to.',
'Young man, how about you? You wanna give it a try?',
'Ah, no, no, no, thanks.',
'Hey, Doc, this…',
'Son? Sonny boy?',
'The Doc can dance?',
'Son? Son? Son!',
'Hey, hey! I just told you that even a baby could handle this weapon. Surely you’re not afraid to try something that a baby could do.',
'Hey, I’m not afraid of nothin’.',
'Well, come on, then. Let’s just step up here like a man.',
'Now here. What you do is you just ease that hammer back there… and squeeze off a round.',
'No, no, no! No. Right on out there and be real smooth. That’s the way you do it.',
'Oh… Ho ho ho ho, gaw…!',
'Listen, can I try that again?',
'Yes, yeah, go ahead…!',
'Uh—Just tell me one thing: Where’d you learn to shoot like that?',
'7-Eleven.',
'Buford, you sure that blacksmith is gonna be at this here shindig?',
'Sure he’s here. Everybody’s here tonight.',
'You gentlemen will have to check your firearms if you want to join in on the festivities.',
'Who’s gonna make us, tenderfoot? You?!',
'I am.',
'Marshal Strickland.',
'I didn’t know you was back in town.',
'If you can’t read the sign, Tannen, I presume you can read this.',
'Pretty tough hombre when you’re pointing a scattergun at a man’s back.',
'Just like you, Tannen, I take every advantage I can get. Now you gonna check your iron?',
'I was just joking with your deputy. Of course I’m gonna check my iron. We all were, weren’t we, boys?!',
'Yeah, right!',
'Tannen. Your knife too.',
'Smile, Marshal. After all, this is a party.',
'Only party I’ll be smiling at is the one that sees you at the end of a rope.',
'Have fun!',
'See, that’s how you handle them, Son. Never give them an inch, and maintain discipline at all times. Remember that word: discipline.',
'I will, Pa.',
'…Swing that partner with a right, big swing. Over to the side, it’s the same old thing… 🎵',
'…Thank you very much.',
'Why… Mister Eastwood. Nice to see ya.',
'I see you got yourself some respectable clothes now, and a fine hat.',
'Yeah, well, a couple people didn’t like the way the other one looked on me.',
'Sure, an’ that one suits you, Mister Eastwood. It’s very becomin’.',
'Well, thanks.',
'Hey, “Frisbie”. Far out.',
'What was the meanin’ o’ that?',
'It was right in front of ‘im.',
'Aye.',
'…Swing that partner halfway ‘round. Sashay back to the head of the set. 🎵',
'All the way up to the head of the set. Now bow to the partner—you’re through! 🎵',
'Hey, that’s mine!',
'Not anymore.',
'Gimme that.',
'There he is, Buford.',
'Where?',
'There. Dancing with that piece a calico.',
'What’re you gonna do, boss?',
'Figure… I bury this muzzle deep enough in his back, nobody will hear the shot.',
'Careful, Buford, you ain’ got but one bullet with that.',
'I only need one.',
'I told you to watch your back, smithy.',
'Tannen. But you’re early.',
'It’s a Derringer, smithy. Small but effective. Last time I used it, fella took two whole days to die. Bled to death inside; it was real, real painful.',
'That means you’ll be dead by about supper-time Monday.',
'Excuse me. I don’t know who you think you are, but we’re dancing.',
'Well, looky what we have here.',
'Ain’t you gonna introduce me to the lady?! I’d like a dance!',
'I wouldn’t give you the pleasure. You’ll just have to go ahead and shoot.',
'All right.',
'No, no! Emmett, I’ll dance with him, Emmett, I’ll dance with him.',
'Boys, keep the blacksmith company while I get acquainted with the filly!',
'Yahoo! Ha ha! Yeah!',
'I don’t dance very well when my partner has a gun in his hand.',
'Ah, you’ll learn. You’ll learn.',
'You know, smithy, maybe I’ll just take my $80 worth outta her!',
'Tannen, leave her alone!',
'Whoo! Ha ha ha! Yeah. I bet there’s something you can do that’s worth $80.',
'I believe you’ve underestimated me, mister.',
'Well, have I now?',
'Ow!! Ah!',
'Ow!',
'Aargh! Stop it!! Damn you, Tannen!',
'No. I damn you. I damn you… to hell!',
'You!',
'Hey, lighten up, jerk!',
'Mighty strong words, runt! You man enough to back ‘em up with more than just a pie plate?',
'Look, just leave my friends alone.',
'Uh, what’s wrong, dude? You yella?!',
'Ha ha. That’s what I thought. Yella belly.',
'Nobody… calls me yellow.',
'Let’s finish it. Right now!',
'Oh, uh. Not now, Buford. Marshal’s got our guns.',
'Like I said, we’ll finish this tomorrow!',
'Tomorrow we’re robbin’ the Pine City stage.',
'What about Monday? We doin’ anything Monday?',
'Uh… No. Monday’d be fine. You can kill ‘im on Monday.',
'I’ll be back this way on Monday. We’ll settle this then. Right there… out in the street… in front of the Palace Saloon.',
'Yeah, right. When? High noon?',
'Noon? I do my killing before breakfast. 7:00!',
'8:00. I do my killing after breakfast.',
'(Marty!)',
'All right, now. Break it up. What’s all this about? You causin’ trouble here, Tannen?',
'No trouble, Marshal. Just a little personal matter between me and Eastwood! This don’t concern the law.',
'Tonight, everything concerns the law. Now break it up. Any brawlin’, it’s fifteen days in the county jail.',
'All right, folks, come on! This is a party! Come on, let’s have some fun!',
'8:00 Monday, runt. You ain’ here, I’ll hunt you and shoot you down like a duck.',
'It’s “dog”, Buford. “Shoot ‘im down like a dog.”',
'Let’s go, boys! Let these sissies have their party!',
'Marty, what are you doing, saying you’re gonna meet Tannen?',
'Hey, Doc, Doc. Don’t worry about it. Monday morning, 8 AM. We’re gonna be gone, right?',
'Theoretically, yes, but what if the train’s late?',
'Late?',
'We’ll discuss this later.',
'No, we’ll discuss it now. Late? What do you mean?',
'Thank you for your gallantry, Mister Eastwood.',
'Oh, hey, ma’am.',
'Had you not interceded, Emmett might have been shot.',
'Marty—uh, Clint. I’m gonna take Clara home.',
'Right. Good night, Doc. Good night, Clara.',
'You sure set him straight, Mister Eastwood. I’m glad somebody finally got the gumption to stand up to that son of a bitch.',
'You’re all right in my book, Mister Eastwood. I’d like to buy you a drink.',
'Hey, listen, I don’t want a drink. You don’t have to buy me anything. It was no big deal.',
'Young man, young man! I’d like for you to have this brand-new Colt Peacemaker and gun belt—free of charge.',
'Free?',
'I wan’ ev’rybody to know that the gun that shot Buford Tannen was a Colt Peacemaker!',
'Hey, hey. No problem. Thanks a lot.',
'Of course, uh, you understand that if you lose, I’m takin’ it back.',
'Thanks again!',
'You had ‘im, Mister Eastwood! You could’ve just walked away, and nobody would’ve thought the less of you for it. All it would’ve been was words, hot air from a buffoon.',
'‘Stead, you let him rile you. Rile you into playing his game, his way, by his rules.',
'Seamus, relax, I know what I’m doin’.',
'He reminds me of poor Martin.',
'Aye.',
'Who?',
'Me brother.',
'Wait a minute, wait a minute. You have a brother named Martin McFly?',
'Had a brother.',
'Martin used to let men provoke him into fightin’.',
'He was concerned that people would think ‘im a coward if he refused. That’s how he got a Bowie knife shoved through his belly in a saloon in Virginia City.',
'Never considered the future, poor Martin, God rest his soul.',
'Sure, an’ I hope you’re considerin’ the future, Mister Eastwood.',
'I think about it all the time.',
'And that crater in the middle northwest, the one that’s out there all by itself like a starburst…',
'Uh-huh.',
'…That one’s called Copernicus.',
'Hah, listen to me! I feel like I’m teaching school. Hah, ha ha…',
'No, no, no. Please, continue the lesson. I never found lunar geography so fascinating. You’re quite knowledgeable.',
'When I was eleven, I had diphtheria. I was quarantined for three months. So my father brought this telescope, and he put it next to my bed so I could see everything out the window.',
'Emmett, do you think we’ll ever be able to travel to the moon the way we travel across the country on trains?',
'Definitely. Although not for eighty-four years and not on trains. We’ll have space vehicles, capsules sent aloft with rockets. Devices that create giant explosions. Explosions so powerful that they just—',
'They break the pull of the earth’s gravity and send the projectile through outer space.',
'Emmett! I read that book too!',
'You—You’re quoting Jules Verne, “From the Earth to the Moon”.',
'You’ve read Jules Verne?',
'I adore Jules Verne.',
'So do I. “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea”. My absolute favorite.',
'The first time I read that when I was a little boy, why, I wanted to meet Captain Nemo—',
'Don’t tease, Emmett. You couldn’t have read that when you were a boy. It was only first published ten years ago.',
'Oh… Yes, well… I meant… It made me feel like a boy.',
'I never met a woman who liked Jules Verne before.',
'I never ever met a man like you before.',
'Doc?',
'Hope you know what you’re doin’.',
'You talkin’ to me?',
'You talkin’ to me, Tannen?!',
'Well, I’m the only one here.',
'Go ahead! Make my day.',
'Say, good morning, Mister Eastwood.',
'Morning.',
'Have a cigar, Mister Eastwood. Anything I can do for you today, Mister Eastwood?',
'Uh… No, that’s… fine. I don’t—',
'Good luck tomorrow, Mister Eastwood. We’ll be prayin’ for you.',
'Thanks.',
'Good morning, Mister Eastwood. Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow?',
'Uh… I’m—I’m fine. Thanks.',
'Doc! What are you doing?',
'Oh, nothing. I was just out enjoying the morning air.',
'It’s really lovely here in the morning. Don’t you think?',
'Yeah, it’s lovely, Doc. Listen, we’ve got to load the DeLorean up and get ready to roll, all right—?',
'Hey. Look at that, the tombstone.',
'Marty, let me see that photograph again!',
'My name, it’s vanished.',
'Hey, that’s great, Doc! Don’t you get it? We’re going back to the future tomorrow, so everything’s being erased.',
'But only my name is erased! The tombstone itself and the date still remain. That doesn’t make sense.',
'We know that this photograph represents what will happen if the events of today continue to run their course into tomorrow.',
'Right, so?',
'Excuse me, Mister Eastwood. I just need to take your measurements.',
'Oh, look, pal. I don’t want to buy a suit.',
'Ha ha. No, this is for your coffin.',
'My coffin?',
'Well, the odds are running two to one against you. Might as well be prepared!',
'So it may not be my name that’s supposed to end up on this tombstone. It may be yours.',
'Great Scott!',
'I know. This is heavy.',
'Marty, why are you wearing that gun? You’re not considering going up against Tannen tomorrow?',
'Doc, tomorrow morning I’m going back to the future with you. But if Buford Tannen comes lookin’ for trouble, I’m gonna be ready for him. You heard what that son of a bitch called me last night.',
'Marty, you can’t go losing your judgment every time someone calls you a name. That’s exactly what causes you to get into that accident in the future.',
'What?! What about my future?',
'I can’t tell you. It might make things worse.',
'Wait a minute. Doc! What is wrong with my future?',
'Marty, we all have to make decisions that affect the course of our lives. You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do. And I’ve got to do what I’ve got to do.',
'Marty.',
'Yeah.',
'I’ve made a decision.',
'Uh-huh.',
'I’m not going with you tomorrow. I’m staying here.',
'What’re you talking about, Doc?!',
'There’s no point in denying it. I’m in love with Clara.',
'Oh, man. Doc, we don’t belong here! Neither one of us!',
'You know, it could still be you that gets shot tomorrow. This tombstone could still be in your future!',
'Marty, the future isn’t written. It can be changed. You know that.',
'Anyone can make their future whatever they want it to be.',
'I can’t let this one little photograph determine my entire destiny.',
'I have to live my life according to what I believe is right… in my heart.',
'Doc. You’re a scientist. So you tell me. What’s the right thing to do… up here?',
'You’re right, Marty.',
'Wow, that worked great.',
'I’ve at least got to tell her goodbye.',
'Come on, Doc. Think about it. What’re you gonna say to her? “I’ve got to go back to the future?” I mean, she’s not gonna understand that, Doc. Hell, I’m in it with you, and I don’t even understand it.',
'Doc, listen. Maybe we—I don’t know, maybe we can just take Clara with us.',
'To the future?',
'As you reminded me, Marty, I’m a scientist, so I must be scientific about this.',
'I cautioned you about disrupting the continuum for your own personal benefit. Therefore, I must do no less.',
'We shall proceed as planned, and as soon as we return to 1985, we’ll destroy this infernal machine.',
'Traveling through time has become much too painful.',
'It’s Emmett, Clara.',
'Oh! Emmett… Won’t you come in?',
'No, I better not. I…',
'What’s wrong?',
'I’ve come to say goodbye.',
'Goodbye? Well, where’re you going?',
'I’m going away. And well, I’m afraid I’ll never see you again.',
'Emmett!',
'Clara. I want you to know that I care about you deeply. But I’ve realized that I don’t belong here, and I have to go back where I came from.',
'And where might that be?',
'I can’t tell you.',
'Oh. Well, wherever you’re going, take me with you.',
'I can’t, Clara. I wish it didn’t have to be this way, but just believe me when I tell you that I’ll never forget you, and that… I love you.',
'I don’t understand what you’re trying to say.',
'Clara. I don’t think there’s any way that you can understand it.',
'Please, Emmett. Please, I have to know. If you sincerely do love me, then tell me the truth.',
'All right then. I’m from the future.',
'I came here in a time machine that I invented, and tomorrow I have to go back to the year 1985.',
'Oh. Yes, Emmett. I do understand.',
'I understand that because you know I’m partial to the writings of Jules Verne, you concocted those mendacities in order to take advantage of me!',
'Oh! I’ve heard some whoppers in my day, but the fact that you’d expect me to entertain a notion like that is so insulting and degrading!',
'All you had to say is, “I don’t love you, and I don’t want to see you anymore.” That, at least, would have been respectful!',
'But that’s not the truth!',
'Right over here, sir.',
'Good to see you too.',
'Emmett! What can I get you? The usual?',
'No, Chester, I’m gonna need something a lot stronger than that tonight.',
'Sarsaparilla.',
'Whiskey, Chester.',
'Whiskey? Emmett, are you sure? You know what happened to you on the Fourth of July.',
'Whiskey.',
'Okay, I ain’t your papa. Just don’t want to see you do the wrong thing.',
'And you can leave the bottle.',
'It’s a woman, right?',
'I knew it. I have seen that look on a man’s face a thousand times all across the country.',
'All I can tell you, friend, is you’ll get over her.',
'Oh. Clara was one in a million. One in a billion. One in a googolplex. The woman of my dreams, and I’ve lost her for all time.',
'Ah. I can assure you, sir, there are other women.',
'Why, if peddling this barbed wire all across the country has taught me one thing for certain, it’s that you never know what the future might bring.',
'Well, the future. Oh, I can tell you about the future.',
'Ah… Oh, man, did I sleep.',
'Ah… What time is it, Doc?',
'Doc?!',
'Wake up!!',
'Get up!! Let’s go!! I got me a runt to kill.',
'It’s still early, boss. What’s your hurry?',
'I’m hungry.',
'And in the future, we don’t need horses. We have motorized carriages called “automobiles”.',
'Ha ha ha ha…!',
'If everybody’s got one of these auto-whatsits, uh, does anybody walk or run anymore?',
'Of course we run. But for recreation, for fun.',
'Run for fun?! What the hell kind of fun is that?',
'Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha…!',
'Doc! Doc!',
'How much has he had?',
'None! That’s the first one; he hasn’t touched it yet.',
'Ah, ha ha ha…!',
'He just likes to hold it.',
'Doc! Doc! What are you doing?!',
'I’ve lost her, Marty. There’s nothing left for me here.',
'All right, that’s why you gotta come back with me.',
'Where?',
'Back to the future!',
'Right! Let’s get going!',
'Great.',
'Gentlemen, excuse me, but my friend and I have to catch a train.',
'Here’s to you, blacksmith! Ha ha ha ha!',
'And to the future.',
'Amen.',
'Amen!',
'Emmett, no!',
'Doc! Doc! Doc!',
'Come on, Doc. Wake up! Wake up, Doc!',
'How many did he have?!',
'Just the one.',
'Just the one? Come on, Doc!',
'There’s a fellow that can’t hold his liquor.',
'Get me some coffee. Black!',
'Joey, coffee!',
'Ma’am?',
'How far does the 8:00 train go?',
'San Francisco is the end of the line.',
'I’ll take a one-way ticket.',
'You want to sober him up in a hurry, son, you’re gonna have to use something a lot stronger than coffee.',
'Yeah, what do you suggest?',
'Joey! Let’s make some wake-up juice.',
'Come on, Doc. Swallow. Here we go…',
'In about ten minutes, he’s gonna be as sober as a priest on Sunday.',
'Ten minutes! Why do we have to cut these things so damn close?',
'Here, stick this clothespin on his nose.',
'And when he opens up his mouth, go ahead and pour it on down his gullet.',
'Oh, and stand back.',
'He’s still out!',
'Oh, that? That was just a reflex action. It’s gonna take a few more minutes for the stuff to really clear up his head.',
'Perfect.',
'Come on, Doc. Come on, wake up, buddy. Wake up, Doc! Come on. Come on.',
'Seamus, wouldn’t expect to see you here this morning.',
'Aye… Something inside me told me I should be here. As if my future had something to do with it.',
'He’ll come around in a minute. Come on!',
'Come on, Doc. Let’s go, Doc! Let’s wake up now, buddy. Come on…',
'Are you in there, Eastwood?! It’s 8:00! And I’m calling you out!',
'It’s not 8:00 yet!',
'It is by my watch! Let’s settle this once and for all, runt! Or ain’t you got the gumption?',
'Listen… I’m not really feeling up to this today. So I’m gonna have to forfeit.',
'Forfeit? Forfeit?!',
'What’s that mean?',
'Um, it means that you win without a fight.',
'Without shootin’?! He can’t do that—Hey, you can’t do that!',
'You know what I think?! I think you ain’t nothing but a gutless, yella turd! And I’m giving you to the count of ten to come out here and prove I’m wrong!',
'One…!',
'Doc… Come on, sober up, buddy. Let’s go. Come on…',
'Two…!',
'You better get out there, son. I got $20 gold bet on you, so don’t let me down!',
'Three…!',
'I got $30 gold bet agin you, so don’t let me down!',
'Four…!',
'You better face up to it, son, ‘cause if you don’t go out there—',
'What?! What if I don’t go out there?!',
'Five…!',
'You’re a coward!',
'Six…!',
'And you’ll be branded a coward for the rest of your days!',
'Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood is the biggest yella belly in the West!',
'…Seven…!',
'Here!',
'Eight…!',
'I already got a gun.',
'Nine…!',
'Ten!',
'D’you hear me, runt?! I said that’s ten, you gutless, yella pie-slinger!',
'He’s an asshole!',
'I don’t care what Tannen says! And I don’t care what anybody else says either.',
'Doc! Doc, you okay?!',
'I think so. Whoa… What a headache!',
'Listen, you got a back door to this place?',
'Yeah, it’s in the back.',
'Let’s go, Doc!',
'Are you comin’ out here, or do I have to come in there after you?',
'Thing I really miss here is Tylenol.',
'Hey!',
'Reach, blacksmith!',
'Yes, sir. That poor fellow last night had the worst case of broken heart I have ever seen.',
'When he said he didn’t know how he could live the rest of his life knowing how much hurt he’d caused that little girl. Well, I really felt for him. I did. Right here.',
'Listen up, Eastwood! I aim to shoot somebody today, and I prefer it’d be you. But if you’re just too damn yella, I guess it’ll just have to be your blacksmith friend.',
'Forget about me, Marty, and save yourself!',
'You got one minute to decide. You hear me, runt? One minute!',
'I’ve never seen a man so broken up over a woman. What’d he say her name was? Cara? Sarah?',
'Clara.',
'Clara!',
'Excuse me.',
'Ma’am?',
'But was this man tall with great, big, brown puppy-dog eyes and long, silvery flowing hair?',
'You know him.',
'Emmett!',
'Time’s up, runt!',
'Prepare to meet your maker, blacksmith.',
'Right here, Tannen!',
'Draw!',
'No!',
'I thought we could settle this like men!',
'You thought wrong, dude.',
'Ha ha ha… Ah! Heh heh heh… Uh, thank you…',
'Aargh!!',
'Ah-argh!!',
'Ah-aargh!!',
'Ha! That was good.',
'You know what I think?',
'No.',
'I think Buford’s goin’ to jail.',
'Yeah.',
'Get him out of that shit.',
'Get ‘em!',
'Buford Tannen, you’re under arrest for robbin’ the Pine City stage. You got anything to say?',
'I hate manure.',
'Look!',
'Yes!',
'The train!',
'Can we make it?!',
'We’ll have to cut ‘em off at Coyote Pass.',
'Hey! Hey, mister! Mister Eastwood! Here’s your gun, mister!',
'Thanks, kid.',
'Seamus! It’s worth $12. Never been used.',
'Maybe I’ll trade it for a new hat!',
'Right. And take care of that baby!',
'I will!',
'Emmett! Emmett!',
'“Time Machine”…',
'C’mon, Marty!',
'Doc!',
'Come on, give me your hand!',
'Come on, Marty!',
'Aah! Ah! Ah!',
'Come on, let’s go!',
'Masks on.',
'Reach!',
'Is this a holdup?!',
'It’s a science experiment!',
'Stop the train just before you hit the switch track up ahead!',
'Doc!',
'Uncouple the cars from the tender!',
'I’ve wanted to do that all my life!',
'What are these things, anyway?',
'My own version of Pres-to-Logs. Compressed wood with anthracite dust, chemically treated to burn hotter and longer. I use them in my forge so I don’t have to stoke it.',
'These three in the furnace will ignite sequentially, make the fire burn hotter, kick up the boiler pressure, and make the train go faster!',
'Hyah!',
'Ready to roll!',
'Emmett!',
'Marty, are the time circuits on?!',
'Check, Doc!',
'Input the destination time! October 27, 1985, 11 AM!',
'Check! Okay, we’re cruising at a steady 25 miles an hour, Doc!',
'I’m throwing in the Pres-to-Logs!',
'Marty, the new gauge on the dashboard will tell us the boiler temperature! It’s color-coded to indicate when each log will fire: green, yellow, and red! Each detonation will be accompanied by a sudden burst of acceleration!',
'Hopefully we’ll hit 88 miles per hour before the needle gets much past 2,000!',
'Why?! Wh—What happens after it hits 2,000?!',
'The whole boiler explodes!',
'Perfect!',
'Hey, Doc, we just hit 35!',
'Okay, Marty, I’m comin’ aboard!',
'Emmett…! Emmett…!',
'Come on, come on…',
'You better hold onto somethin’, Doc, the yellow log’s about to blow!',
'Ah! …Golly.',
'We just passed 40, Doc!',
'Emmett…! Emmett…! Emmett…!',
'We just passed 45, Doc! Go for it!',
'50.',
'Emmett!',
'Clara!',
'I love you!',
'Doc! Doc, what’s happening?!',
'It’s Clara! She’s on the train!',
'Clara? Perfect.',
'She’s in the cab! I’m gonna go back for her!',
'The windmill! Doc! The windmill! We’re goin’ past 50! You’ll never make it!',
'Then we’ll have to take her back with us! Keep calling out the speed!',
'Clara, climb out here to me!',
'I don’t know if I can!',
'You can do it! Just don’t look down!',
'That’s it!',
'60 miles an hour, Doc!',
'You’re doing fine! Nice and steady!',
'Come on! Just a little further!',
'I can’t, Emmett! I’m scared!',
'70!',
'Keep coming, Clara!',
'Come on! Come on, you’re doing fine! Come on!',
'Nice and easy! Don’t look down! That’s it! You’re doing fine!',
'Doc! The red log is about to blow!!',
'Aah! Aaah!!',
'Clara!!',
'Emmett!!',
'I’m trying to reach you!',
'Clara! Hold on!',
'I can’t—aah!!',
'Oh! Doc, I’m gonna slip you the hoverboard!',
'Marty! Watch out!',
'Aargh!',
'Aah! Emmett, help!',
'Hold on, Clara!!',
'Doc! Ready, Doc?! Catch it!',
'Yes! Yes!',
'Emmett!!',
'Hold on!!',
'Aaah!',
'Yes!',
'Sh—!',
'Well, Doc… It’s destroyed… Just like you wanted.',
'Hey, butthead! Get away—!',
'Watch it, Biff!',
'Marty! I—I didn’t mean to scare you! I—I didn’t recognize you in those clothes!',
'What the hell are you doin’?',
'Uh, just… puttin’ on the second coat now, heh.',
'You goin’ cowboy, huh?',
'Come on, guys! We’re gonna be late for brunch!',
'Coming, Dave.',
'Come on, Dad, we’re not gonna hold your reservations all day!',
'I can’t find my other glasses. Lorraine, have you seen my glasses?',
'They’re in your suede jacket, honey.',
'Marty… What’s wrong? We thought you went to the lake.',
'You wore that to the lake?',
'Thank God you guys are all back to normal!',
'Marty, who are you supposed to be? Clint Eastwood? Ha…!',
'Right… I gotta go get Jennifer.',
'I really like that hat, Marty!',
'Thanks, Biff.',
'Jennifer… Jen… Jennifer…',
'Marty… Marty! I had the worst nightmare.',
'Marty, that dream I had is so real. It was about the future… About us… And you got fired!',
'Wait a minute. What do you mean I got fired?',
'“Hilldale”. Hilldale! This is where we live.',
'I mean, this is, uh, this is where we’re going to live… Someday.',
'Marty, it was a dream, wasn’t it?',
'Hey! The big M. How’s it hanging, McFly?',
'Hey, Needles.',
'Nice set of wheels! Let’s see what she can do. Next green light.',
'No, thanks.',
'What’s the matter? Chicken?!',
'Oo, chicken McFly! Ah, ha ha ha…! Whoo! Yeah, whoo!',
'Marty, don’t.',
'Grab hold of something.',
'Come on! Get on!',
'Yeah, go! Go, go, go!',
'Whoa! Did you do that on purpose?',
'Yeah, you think I’m stupid enough to race that asshole?',
'Jeez… I would’ve hit that Rolls-Royce.',
'It erased.',
'You’re right, there’s not much left.',
'Doc’s never coming back.',
'I’m sure gonna miss him, Jen.',
'What the hell?',
'Doc!',
'Marty!',
'Doc! Doc!',
'Marty! It runs on steam!',
'Meet the family. Clara you know.',
'Hi, Marty!',
'Ma’am!',
'These are our boys: Jules… and Verne.',
'Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.',
'Doc, I thought I’d never see ya again!',
'You can’t keep a good scientist down! After all, I had to come back for Einstein! And, well, I didn’t want you to be worried about me.',
'Oh. I brought you a little souvenir.',
'It’s great, Doc! Thanks.',
'Doctor Brown? I brought this note back from the future, and… now it’s erased?',
'Of course it’s erased!',
'But what does that mean?',
'It means your future hasn’t been written yet! No one’s has!',
'Your future is whatever you make it! So make it a good one! Both of you!',
'We will, Doc!',
'Stand back!',
'All right, boys, buckle up!',
'Hey, Doc! Where you going now?! Back to the future?!',
'Nope! Already been there!',
'THE END',
